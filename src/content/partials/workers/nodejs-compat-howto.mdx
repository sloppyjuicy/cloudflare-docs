To enable built-in Node.js APIs and polyfills, add the nodejs_compat compatibility flag to your `wrangler.toml`. This also enables nodejs_compat_v2 as long as your compatibility date is 2024-09-23 or later. [Learn more about the Node.js compatibility flag and v2](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).
