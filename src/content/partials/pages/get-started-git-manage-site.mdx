### Delete a project

To delete your Pages project:

1. Go back to the **Account Home** or use the drop-down menu at the top of the dashboard.
2. Select **Workers & Pages**.
3. Select your Pages project > **Settings** > **Delete project**.

:::caution


For projects with a custom domain, you must first delete the CNAME record associated with your Pages project. Failure to do so may leave the DNS records active, causing your domain to point to a Pages project that no longer exists. Refer to [Deleting a custom domain](/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#delete-a-custom-domain) for instructions.

For projects without a custom domain (any project on a `*.pages.dev` subdomain), your project can be deleted in the project's settings.

## Advanced project settings

In the **Settings** section, you can configure advanced settings, such as changing your project name, updating your Git configuration, or updating your build command, build directory or environment variables.
