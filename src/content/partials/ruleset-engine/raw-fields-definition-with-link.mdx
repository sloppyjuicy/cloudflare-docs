import { Markdown } from "~/components";

This is the raw field version of the <Markdown text={props.fieldLink}/> field. Raw fields, prefixed with `raw.`, preserve original request values for later evaluations. These fields are immutable during the entire request evaluation workflow, and they are not affected by the actions of previously matched rules.
