:::note
Advanced TCP and DNS Protection systems are automatically enabled in `Monitor` mode with the default thresholds for new Magic Transit customers and their [authorized prefixes](/magic-transit/how-to/advertise-prefixes/).

Magic Transit customers can also enable the Advanced DDoS systems when the prefixes are ready, change the sensitivity level, or adjust the thresholds by contacting their account team.
