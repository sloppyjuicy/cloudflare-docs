Increases saturation by a factor. A value of `1.0` equals no change, a value of `0.5` equals half saturation, and a value of `2.0` equals twice as saturated. A value of `0` will convert the image to grayscale.

  <TabItem label="URL format">
    ```js 
    saturation=0.5
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Workers">
  ```js 
  cf: {image: {saturation: 0.5}}
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
