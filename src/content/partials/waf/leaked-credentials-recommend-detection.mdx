:::note[Recommendation: Use leaked credentials detection instead]
Cloudflare recommends that you use [leaked credentials detection](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) instead of Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check, which refers to a previous implementation.<br/>
For more information on upgrading your current Exposed Credentials Check configuration, refer to the [upgrade guide](/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/upgrade-to-leaked-credentials-detection/).
