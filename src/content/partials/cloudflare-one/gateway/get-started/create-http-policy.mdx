import { Render, Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components";

To create a new HTTP policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **HTTP** tab, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression. For example, if you have configured TLS decryption, some applications that use [embedded certificates](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#inspection-limitations) may not support HTTP inspection, such as some Google products. You can create a policy to bypass inspection for these applications:

   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/do-not-inspect-applications"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />

   Cloudflare also recommends adding a policy to block [known threats](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/#security-categories) such as Command & Control, Botnet and Malware based on Cloudflare's threat intelligence:

   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/block-security-categories"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />

6. Select **Create policy**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

1. [Create an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

   | Type    | Item       | Permission |
   | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
   | Account | Zero Trust | Edit       |

2. (Optional) Configure your API environment variables to include your [account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and API token.
3. Send a `POST` request to the [Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/methods/create/) endpoint. For example, if you have configured TLS decryption, some applications that use [embedded certificates](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#inspection-limitations) may not support HTTP inspection, such as some Google products. You can create a policy to bypass inspection for these applications:

   ```sh title="curl API HTTP policy example"
   curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
   --data '{
     "name": "Do not inspect applications",
     "description": "Bypass TLS decryption for unsupported applications",
     "precedence": 0,
     "enabled": true,
     "action": "off",
     "filters": [
       "http"
     ],
     "traffic": "any(app.type.ids[*] in {16})",
     "identity": "",
     "device_posture": ""
   }'
   ```

   ```sh output
   {
   	 "success": true,
   	 "errors": [],
   	 "messages": []
   }
   ```

   The API will respond with a summary of the policy and the result of your request.

   Cloudflare also recommends adding a policy to block [known threats](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/#security-categories) such as Command & Control, Botnet and Malware based on Cloudflare's threat intelligence:

   ```bash title="Block known risks HTTP policy"
   curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
   --data '{
     "name": "Block known risks",
     "description": "Block all default Cloudflare HTTP security categories",
     "precedence": 0,
     "enabled": true,
     "action": "block",
     "filters": [
       "http"
     ],
     "traffic": "any(http.request.uri.security_category[*] in {68 178 80 83 176 175 117 131 134 151 153})",
     "identity": "",
     "device_posture": ""
   }'
   ```
