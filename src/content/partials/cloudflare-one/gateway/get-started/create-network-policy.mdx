import { Render, Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components";

To create a new network policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **Network** tab, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression. For example, you can use a list of [device serial numbers](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/corp-device/) to ensure users can only access an application if they connect with the WARP client from a company device:

   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/enforce-device-posture"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />

6. Select **Create policy**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

1. [Create an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

   | Type    | Item       | Permission |
   | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
   | Account | Zero Trust | Edit       |

2. (Optional) Configure your API environment variables to include your [account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and API token.
3. Send a `POST` request to the [Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/methods/create/) endpoint. For example, you can use a list of [device serial numbers](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/corp-device/) to ensure users can only access an application if they connect with the WARP client from a company device:

   ```sh title="curl API network policy example"
   curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
   --data '{
     "name": "Enforce device posture",
     "description": "Ensure only devices in Zero Trust organization can connect to application",
     "precedence": 0,
     "enabled": true,
     "action": "block",
     "filters": [
     	 "l4"
     ],
     "traffic": "any(net.sni.domains[*] == \"internalapp.com\")",
     "identity": "",
     "device_posture": "not(any(device_posture.checks.passed[*] in {\"<LIST_UUID>\"}))"
   }'
   ```

   ```sh output
   {
   	 "success": true,
   	 "errors": [],
   	 "messages": []
   }
   ```

   The API will respond with a summary of the policy and the result of your request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>
