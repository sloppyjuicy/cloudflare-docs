1. Go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. In **Firewall**, turn on **Proxy**.
3. Select **TCP**.
4. (Recommended) To proxy traffic to internal DNS resolvers, select **UDP**.
5. (Recommended) To proxy traffic for diagnostic tools such as `ping` and `traceroute`, select **ICMP**. You may also need to [update your system](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/troubleshoot-tunnels/common-errors/#ping-and-traceroute-commands-do-not-work) to allow ICMP traffic through `cloudflared`.

Cloudflare will now proxy traffic from enrolled devices, except for the traffic excluded in your [split tunnel settings](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp). For more information on how Gateway forwards traffic, refer to [Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/).
