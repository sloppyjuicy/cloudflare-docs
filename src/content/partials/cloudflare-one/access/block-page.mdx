You can customize the block page that displays when users fail to authenticate to an Access application. Each application can have a different block page.

:::note[Gateway block page]
To customize the page that users see when they are blocked by a Gateway firewall policy, refer to [Gateway block page](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/block-page/).

## Types of block pages

Cloudflare Access offers three different block page options:

- **Default**: Displays a Cloudflare branded block page.
- **Custom Redirect URL** - Redirects blocked requests to the specified URL. For example, you could redirect the user to a [dynamic Access Denied page](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-identity-dynamic) that fetches their identity and shows the exact reason they were blocked.
- **Custom Page Template** - (Only available on Pay-as-you-go and Enterprise plans) Displays a [custom HTML page](/cloudflare-one/applications/block-page/#create-a-custom-block-page) hosted by Cloudflare.

### Identity versus non-identity

You can display a different [type of block page](/cloudflare-one/applications/block-page/#types-of-block-pages) to users who fail an identity-based policy versus a non-identity policy.

- **Identity failure block page**: Displays when the user fails an identity-based Access policy (such as email, user group, or external evaluation rule), after logging in to their identity provider.
- **Non-identity failure block page**: Displays when the user fails a non-identity Access policy (such as country, IP, or device posture). Cloudflare checks non-identity attributes before prompting the user to login. Therefore, the non-identity block page would take precedence over the identity block page.

## Create a custom block page

Only available on Pay-as-you-go and Enterprise plans.
:::

To create a custom block page for Access:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

2. Find the **Access Custom Pages** setting and select **Manage**.

3. Select **Add a page template**.

4. Enter a unique name for the block page.

5. In **Type**, select whether this is an [identity or non-identity block page](/cloudflare-one/applications/block-page/#identity-versus-non-identity).

6. In **Custom HTML**, enter the HTML code for your custom page. For example,

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
   	<body>
   		<h1>Access denied.</h1>

   		<p>To obtain access, contact your IT administrator.</p>
   	</body>
   </html>
   ```

7. To check the appearance of your custom page, select **Download** and open the HTML file in a browser.

8. Once you are satisfied with your custom page, select **Save**.

You can now select this block page when you [configure an Access application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/).
