When you integrate a third-party SaaS application or cloud environment with Cloudflare CASB, you allow CASB to make API calls to its endpoint and read relevant data on your behalf. The CASB integration permissions are read-only and follow the least privileged model. In other words, only the minimum access required to perform a scan is granted.

### Prerequisites

Before you can integrate a SaaS application or cloud environment with CASB, your account with that integration must meet certain requirements. Refer to the SaaS application or cloud environment's [integration guide](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/) to learn more about the prerequisites and permissions.

### Add an integration

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **CASB** > **Integrations**.
2. Select **Connect an integration** or **Add integration**.
3. Browse the available integrations and select the application you would like to add.
4. Follow the step-by-step integration instructions in the UI.
5. To run your first scan, select **Save integration**.

After the first scan, CASB will automatically scan your SaaS application or cloud environment on a frequent basis to keep up with any changes. Scan intervals will vary due to each application having their own set of requirements, but the frequency is typically between every 1 hour and every 24 hours.

Once CASB detects at least one finding, you can [view and manage your findings](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/manage-findings/).

### Pause an integration

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **CASB** > **Integrations**.
2. Find the integration you would like to pause and select **Manage**.
3. To stop scanning the application, turn off **Scan findings**.

You can resume CASB scanning at any time by turning on **Scan findings**.

### Delete an integration

:::caution
When you delete an integration, all keys and OAuth data will be deleted. This means you cannot restore a deleted integration or its scanned data.
