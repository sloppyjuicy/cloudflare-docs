1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. In **Device enrollment permissions**, select **Manage**.
3. In the **Rules** tab, configure one or more [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to define who can join their device. For example, you could allow all users with a company email address:
    | Rule type | Selector | Value |
   | --------- | ---------| ------ |
   | Include   | Emails ending in    | `@company.com` |

:::note

Device posture checks are not supported in device enrollment policies. WARP can only perform posture checks after the device is enrolled.
:::

4. In the **Authentication** tab, select the [identity providers](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) users can authenticate with. If you have not integrated an identity provider, you can use the [one-time PIN](/cloudflare-one/identity/one-time-pin/).
5. Select **Save**.

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.40.0/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Access: Apps and Policies Write`

2. Use the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.45.0/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_application) resource to create an application with type `warp`.

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application" "warp_enrollment_app" {
		account_id                = var.cloudflare_account_id
		session_duration          = "18h"
		name                      = "Warp device enrollment"
		allowed_idps              = [cloudflare_zero_trust_access_identity_provider.microsoft_entra_id.id]
		auto_redirect_to_identity = true
		type                      = "warp"
		app_launcher_visible      = false
	}
	```

3. Use the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.45.0/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_policy) resource to define enrollment permissions.

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy" "warp_enrollment_employees" {
		application_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application.warp_enrollment_app.id
		account_id     = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name           = "Allow company emails"
		decision       = "allow"
		precedence     = 1

		include {
			email_domain = ["company.com"]
		}
	}
