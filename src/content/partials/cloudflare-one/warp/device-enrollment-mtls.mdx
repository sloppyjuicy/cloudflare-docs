To check for an mTLS certificate:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. [Add an mTLS certificate](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#add-mtls-authentication-to-your-access-configuration) to your account. You can generate a sample certificate using the [Cloudflare PKI toolkit](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-mtls-using-cloudflare-pki).

2. In **Associated hostnames**, enter your Zero Trust <GlossaryTooltip term="team domain">team domain</GlossaryTooltip>: `<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`

3. In your [device enrollment permissions](#set-device-enrollment-permissions), add a *Common Name* or *Valid Certificate* rule. For example, the following policy requires a client certificate with a specific common name:

   | Action | Rule type | Selector    | Value                |
   | ------ | --------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
   | Allow  | Require   | Common Name | `<CERT-COMMON-NAME>` |

4. On your device, add the client certificate to the [system keychain](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-in-the-browser).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Terraform">

1. Add the following permissions to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.40.0/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Access: Mutual TLS Certificates Write`
	- `Access: Apps and Policies Write`

2. Use the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_mtls_certificate`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.40.0/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_mtls_certificate) resource to add an mTLS certificate to your account:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_mtls_certificate" "example_mtls_cert" {
		account_id     = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name           = "WARP enrollment mTLS cert"
		certificate    = <<EOT
		-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
		xxxx
		xxxx
		-----END CERTIFICATE-----
		EOT
		associated_hostnames = ["your-team-name.cloudflareaccess.com"]
	}
	```

3. Add the following policy to your [WARP enrollment Access application](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/#set-device-enrollment-permissions):

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy" "warp_enrollment_employees" {
		application_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application.warp_enrollment_app.id
		account_id     = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name           = "Allow company emails"
		decision       = "allow"
		precedence     = 1

		include {
			email_domain = ["company.com"]
		}

		require {
			common_names = ["Common name 1", "Common name 2"]
		}
	}
	```

4. On your device, add the client certificate to the [system keychain](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-in-the-browser).
