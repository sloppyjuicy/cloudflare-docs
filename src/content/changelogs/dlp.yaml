    title: Profile confidence levels
    description: |-
      DLP profiles now support setting a [confidence level](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/advanced-settings/#confidence-levels) to choose how tolerant its detections are to false positives based on the context of the detection. The higher a profile's confidence level is, the less false positives will be allowed. Confidence levels include Low, Medium, or High. DLP profile confidence levels supersede [context analysis](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/advanced-settings/#context-analysis).

    title: Send entire HTTP requests to a Logpush destination
    description: |-
      In addition to [logging the payload](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/logging-options/#log-the-payload-of-matched-rules) from HTTP requests that matched a DLP policy in Cloudflare Logs, Enterprise users can now configure a [Logpush job](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/logging-options/#send-http-requests-to-logpush-destination) to send the entire HTTP request that triggered a DLP match to a storage destination. This allows long-term storage of full requests for use in forensic investigation.

    description: |-
      You can now scan your [Box](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/box/#data-loss-prevention-optional) and [Dropbox](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/dropbox/#data-loss-prevention-optional) files for DLP matches.

    title: Optical character recognition
    description: |-
      DLP can now [detect sensitive data](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/advanced-settings/#optical-character-recognition-ocr) in jpeg, jpg, and png files. This helps companies prevent the leak of sensitive data in images, such as screenshots.
