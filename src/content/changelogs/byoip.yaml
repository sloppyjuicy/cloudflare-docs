    title: Address Maps for BYOIP and Static IPs
    description: Address Maps is available via [API](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/address_maps/methods/list/) and via [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ip-addresses/proxy-ips). Address Maps allows customers with BYOIP prefixes or account-level Static IPs to specify which IP addresses should be mapped to DNS records when they are proxied through Cloudflare. Refer to the [documentation](/byoip/address-maps/) for details.
