    title: Hyperdrive now caches queries in all Cloudflare locations decreasing cache hit latency by up to 90%
    description: |-
      Hyperdrive query caching now happens in all locations where Hyperdrive can be accessed. When making a query in a location that has cached the query result, your latency may be decreased by up to 90%.

      Refer to [documentation on how Hyperdrive caches query results](/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/#query-caching).

    title: Hyperdrive now supports clear-text password authentication
    description: |-
      When connecting to a database that requires secure clear-text password authentication over TLS, Hyperdrive will now support this authentication method.

    title: New Hyperdrive configurations to private databases using Tunnels are validated before creation
    description: |-
      When creating a new Hyperdrive configuration to a private database using Tunnels, Hyperdrive will verify that it can connect to the database to ensure that your Tunnel and Access application have been properly configured. This makes it easier to debug connectivity issues. 

      Refer to [documentation on connecting to private databases](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/) for more information.

    title: The `node-postgres` (pg) driver is now supported for Pages applications using Hyperdrive.
    description: |-
      The popular `pg` ([node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) driver no longer requires the legacy `node_compat` mode, and can now be used in both Workers and Pages for connecting to Hyperdrive. This uses the new (improved) Node.js compatibility in Workers and Pages. 

      You can set [`compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat_v2"]`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) in your `wrangler.toml` or via the Pages dashboard to benefit from this change. Visit the [Hyperdrive documentation on supported drivers](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about the driver versions supported by Hyperdrive.

    title: Increased configuration limits
    description: |-
      You can now create up to 25 Hyperdrive configurations per account, up from the previous maximum of 10.

      Refer to [Limits](/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) to review the limits that apply to Hyperdrive.

    title: Driver performance improvements
    description: |-
      Compatibility improvements to how Hyperdrive interoperates with the popular [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver have been released. These improvements allow queries made via Postgres.js to be correctly cached (when enabled) in Hyperdrive.

      Developers who had previously set `prepare: false` can remove this configuration when establishing a new Postgres.js client instance.

      Read the [documentation on supported drivers](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about database driver interoperability with Hyperdrive.
