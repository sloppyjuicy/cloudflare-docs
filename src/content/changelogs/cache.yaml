    title: Shard Cache by cache key
    description: |-
      For custom cache keys, enterprise customers can now shard their cache using up to three values for previously restricted headers `accept*`, `referer`, and `user-agent`. Sharding the cache can improve cache `HIT` ratio and performance. However, overly sharding your cache, can have the opposite effect.

      The new **Rules** > **Templates** page in the Cloudflare dashboard provides one-click templates for creating cache rules, making it easy to optimize your caching strategy. Access these pre-built templates directly from each product's rule builder, and explore the [Examples gallery](/rules/examples/) in the developer documentation for real-world use cases.

    title: Generic tiered cache
    description: |-
      [Generic Global Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#generic-global-tiered-cache) topology leverages all Cloudflare data centers as upper-tier cache network. It now hashes content within a region reducing duplication in upper-tier caches, which increases cache `HIT` ratio.
