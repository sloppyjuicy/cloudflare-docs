    title: Workers KV REST API bulk operations provide granular errors
    description: |-

      The REST API endpoints for bulk operations ([write](/api/resources/kv/subresources/namespaces/methods/bulk_update/), [delete](/api/resources/kv/subresources/namespaces/methods/bulk_delete/)) now return the keys of operations that failed during the bulk operation. The updated response bodies are documented in the [REST API documentation](/api/resources/kv/subresources/namespaces/methods/list/) and contain the following information in the `result` field:

      ```
      {
        "successful_key_count": number,
        "unsuccessful_keys": string[]
      }
      ```

      The unsuccessful keys are an array of keys that were not written successfully to all storage backends and therefore should be retried.

    title: New KV Analytics API
    description: |-

      Workers KV now has a new [metrics dashboard](/kv/observability/metrics-analytics/#view-metrics-in-the-dashboard) and [analytics API](/kv/observability/metrics-analytics/#query-via-the-graphql-api) that leverages the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) used by many other Cloudflare products. The new analytics API provides per-account and per-namespace metrics for both operations and storage, including latency metrics for read and write operations to Workers KV.

      The legacy Workers KV [analytics REST API](/api/resources/kv/subresources/namespaces/subresources/analytics/methods/list/) will be turned off as of January 31st, 2025.
      Developers using this API will receive a series of email notifications prior to the shutdown of the legacy API.
