The `SqlStorage` interface encapsulates methods that modify the SQLite database embedded within a Durable Object. The `SqlStorage` interface is accessible via the `sql` property of `DurableObjectStorage` class.

For example, using `sql.exec()`, a user can create a table, then insert rows into the table.

```ts
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class MyDurableObject extends DurableObject {
  sql: SqlStorage;
  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);
    this.sql = ctx.storage.sql;

    this.sql.exec(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artist(
      artistid    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      artistname  TEXT
    );INSERT INTO artist (artistid, artistname) VALUES
      (123, 'Alice'),
      (456, 'Bob'),
      (789, 'Charlie');`
    );
  }
}
```

:::note[SQLite in Durable Objects Beta]
SQL API methods accessed with `ctx.storage.sql` are only allowed on [Durable Object classes with SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/#enable-sqlite-storage-backend-on-new-durable-object-class-migration) and will return an error if called on Durable Object classes with a key-value storage backend.

:::note[Writing to indexes or virtual tables]
When writing data, every index counts as an additional row. However, indexes may be beneficial for read-heavy use cases. Refer to [Index for SQLite Durable Objects](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#index-for-sqlite-durable-objects).

Writing data to [SQLite virtual tables](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html) also counts towards rows written.
:::

Specifically for Durable Object classes with SQLite storage backend, KV operations which were previously asynchronous (for example, [`get`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#get), [`put`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#put), [`delete`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#delete), [`deleteAll`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#deleteall), [`list`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#list)) are synchronous, even though they return promises. These methods will have completed their operations before they return the promise.

## Methods

### `exec`

<code>exec(query: <Type text='string'/>, ...bindings: <Type text='any[]'/>)</code>: <Type text='SqlStorageCursor' />

#### Parameters

* `query`: <Type text ='string' />
  * The SQL query string to be executed. `query` can contain `?` placeholders for parameter bindings. Multiple SQL statements, separated with a semicolon, can be executed in the `query`. With multiple SQL statements, any parameter bindings are applied to the last SQL statement in the `query`, and the returned cursor is only for the last SQL statement.
* `...bindings`: <Type text='any[]' /> <MetaInfo text='Optional' />
  * Optional variable number of arguments that correspond to the `?` placeholders in `query`.

#### Returns

A cursor (`SqlStorageCursor`) to iterate over query row results as objects. `SqlStorageCursor` is a JavaScript [Iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol), which supports iteration using `for (let row of cursor)`. `SqlStorageCursor` is also a JavaScript [Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterator_protocol), which supports iteration using `cursor.next()`.

`SqlStorageCursor` supports the following methods:

* `next()`
  * Returns an object representing the next value of the cursor. The returned object has `done` and `value` properties adhering to the JavaScript [Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterator_protocol). `done` is set to `false` when a next value is present, and `value` is set to the next row object in the query result. `done` is set to `true` when the entire cursor is consumed, and no `value` is set.
* `toArray()`
  * Iterates through remaining cursor value(s) and returns an array of returned row objects.
* `one()`
  * Returns a row object if query result has exactly one row. If query result has zero rows or more than one row, `one()` throws an exception.
* `raw()`: <Type text='Iterator' />
  * Returns an Iterator over the same query results, with each row as an array of column values (with no column names) rather than an object.
  * Returned Iterator supports `next()`, `toArray()`, and `one()` methods above.
  * Returned cursor and `raw()` iterator iterate over the same query results and can be combined. For example:

```ts
let cursor = this.sql.exec("SELECT * FROM artist ORDER BY artistname ASC;");
let rawResult = cursor.raw().next();

if (!rawResult.done) {
  console.log(rawResult.value); // prints [ 123, 'Alice' ]
} else {
  // query returned zero results
}

console.log(cursor.toArray()); // prints [{ artistid: 456, artistname: 'Bob' },{ artistid: 789, artistname: 'Charlie' }]
```

`SqlStorageCursor` had the following properties:

* `columnNames`: <Type text='string[]' />
  * The column names of the query in the order they appear in each row array returned by the `raw` iterator.
*  `rowsRead`: <Type text='number' />
  * The number of rows read so far as part of this SQL `query`. This may increase as you iterate the cursor. The final value is used for [SQL billing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sqlite-storage-backend).
*  `rowsWritten`: <Type text='number' />
  * The number of rows written so far as part of this SQL `query`. This may increase as you iterate the cursor. The final value is used for [SQL billing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sqlite-storage-backend).

Note that `sql.exec()` cannot execute transaction-related statements like `BEGIN TRANSACTION` or `SAVEPOINT`. Instead, use the [`ctx.storage.transaction()`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#transaction) or [`ctx.storage.transactionSync()`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#transactionsync) APIs to start a transaction, and then execute SQL queries in your callback.

#### Examples

<Render file="durable-objects-sql" />

### `databaseSize`

`databaseSize`: <Type text ='number' />

#### Returns

The current SQLite database size in bytes.

```ts
let size = ctx.storage.sql.databaseSize;
```

## Point in time recovery

For [Durable Objects classes with SQL storage](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/#enable-sqlite-storage-backend-on-new-durable-object-class-migration), the following point-in-time-recovery (PITR) API methods are available to restore a Durable Object's embedded SQLite database to any point in time in the past 30 days. These methods apply to the entire SQLite database contents, including both the object's stored SQL data and stored key-value data using the key-value `put()` API. The PITR API is not supported in local development because a durable log of data changes is not stored locally.

The PITR API represents points in times using 'bookmarks'. A bookmark is a mostly alphanumeric string like `0000007b-0000b26e-00001538-0c3e87bb37b3db5cc52eedb93cd3b96b`. Bookmarks are designed to be lexically comparable: a bookmark representing an earlier point in time compares less than one representing a later point, using regular string comparison.

### `getCurrentBookmark`

<code>ctx.storage.getCurrentBookmark()</code>: <Type text='Promise<string>' />

* Returns a bookmark representing the current point in time in the object's history.

### `getBookmarkForTime`

<code>ctx.storage.getBookmarkForTime(timestamp: <Type text='number | Date'/>)</code>: <Type text='Promise<string>' />

* Returns a bookmark representing approximately the given point in time, which must be within the last 30 days. If the timestamp is represented as a number, it is converted to a date as if using `new Date(timestamp)`.

### `onNextSessionRestoreBookmark`

<code>ctx.storage.onNextSessionRestoreBookmark(bookmark: <Type text='string'/>)</code>: <Type text='Promise<string>' />

  * Configures the Durable Object so that the next time it restarts, it should restore its storage to exactly match what the storage contained at the given bookmark. After calling this, the application should typically invoke `ctx.abort()` to restart the Durable Object, thus completing the point-in-time recovery.

This method returns a special bookmark representing the point in time immediately before the recovery takes place (even though that point in time is still technically in the future). Thus, after the recovery completes, it can be undone by performing a second recovery to this bookmark.


```ts
let now = new Date();
// restore to 2 days ago
let bookmark = ctx.storage.getBookmarkForTime(now - 2);
ctx.storage.onNextSessionRestoreBookmark(bookmark);
```
