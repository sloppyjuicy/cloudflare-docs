DNS records contain information about your domain and are used to make your website or application available to visitors and other web services.

Each DNS record belongs to a different type, and each type serves a different purpose. For background about the different types of DNS records, refer to the [Learning Center](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/). To quickly find reference information about a specific type, refer to [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).

Depending on the providers you used to [get your domain name](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#get-a-domain-name) and [host your website or application](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#host-your-domain), it is expected that DNS records were automatically created on your behalf. According to your [setup](/dns/zone-setups/), you can use Cloudflare to manage your DNS records.

## DNS records table

When managing your records at Cloudflare, besides the common record fields described below, you may also find an option for [Proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) and [CNAME flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/). These are specific features offered by Cloudflare.

<Details header="Record fields">
- **Type**: Defines the purpose of a record. Different types of record require different information in their corresponding `Content` field.
- **Name**: Identifies the resource that the record resolves to. Depending on the purpose of the record, the value you want to add to this field will also change.
- **Content**: Contains the core value of a record, depending on the record type.
- **TTL**: Controls how long each record is cached by DNS resolvers.
</Details>

<Details header="Example">

<Example>
DNS management for **example.com**:

| Type | Name    | Content      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| A    | `blog`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      | Auto   |

In this example, an IP address resolution record of type `A` is indicating that the resources that correspond to the subdomain `blog.example.com` can be reached on the IPv4 address `192.0.2.1`.

Also, as this record is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/">proxied</GlossaryTooltip>, Cloudflare automatically defines for how long this information should be cached by DNS resolvers.
</Example>
