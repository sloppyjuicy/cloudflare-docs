Consider the sections below for step-by-step instructions on managing DNS records at Cloudflare.

To better understand what DNS records are, refer to [Overview](/dns/manage-dns-records/). For context around common records you want to review when getting started at Cloudflare, refer to [review DNS records](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#review-dns-records).

:::note
If your domain is added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

2. Go to **DNS** > **Records**.
3. Select **Add record**.
4. Choose a record [**Type**](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).
5. Complete the required fields, which vary per record. Particularly important fields (for some records) include:
   - **Proxy status**: For `A`, `AAAA`, and `CNAME` records, decide whether hostname traffic is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/">proxied through Cloudflare</GlossaryTooltip>.
   - **TTL**: Short for [_Time to Live_](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/), this field controls how long each record is valid and — as a result — how long it takes for record updates to reach your end users.
   - **Comment** and **Tag**: [Record attributes](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/record-attributes/) meant for your reference.
6. Select **Save**.
