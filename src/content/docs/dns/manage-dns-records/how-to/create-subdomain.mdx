## Subdomain redirects

For more guidance on redirecting a subdomain — either to your main domain or another location — refer to [Set up subdomain redirects](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#set-up-redirects).

## SSL/TLS for subdomains

While DNS is what communicates where your website or application can be reached, SSL/TLS is what enables websites and applications to establish connections in a secure way.

If your subdomains are not correctly covered by an SSL/TLS certificate, your visitors will find a warning on their browser stating that your website or application is not secure.
