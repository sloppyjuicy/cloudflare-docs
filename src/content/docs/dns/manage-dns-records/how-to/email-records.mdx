There are three reasons to set up email records for your domain:

* To make sure your domain can [receive email](#receive-email).
* To make sure your domain can [send and receive email](#send-and-receive-email).
* To prevent other email senders from [spoofing your domain](#prevent-domain-spoofing).

The exact values for your DNS mail records depend on your email provider. If you have issues, review the [Troubleshooting](/dns/troubleshooting/email-issues/) and contact your email service provider to confirm your DNS records are correct.

### Configure email security records

Refer to [Security records](/dmarc-management/security-records/) to learn how to set up your email security records.

## Proxy SMTP traffic

By default, Cloudflare does not proxy email traffic on port 25 (SMTP). You can only proxy outgoing email if you have [Spectrum](/spectrum/) configured for [SMTP](/spectrum/reference/configuration-options/#smtp).
