When you add a domain to Cloudflare, you may also need to create or review the DNS record on your zone apex. Zone apex refers to the domain (`example.com`) or subdomain (`blog.example.com`) that you are [adding to Cloudflare](/dns/concepts/#zone).

Usually, the zone apex record makes your domain accessible by visitors. In this case, the necessary record type ([A, AAAA, or CNAME](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution)) and its content will depend on the provider that [hosts](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#host-your-domain) your website or application. If you are using Cloudflare Pages, refer to [Custom domains](/pages/configuration/custom-domains/). If you are using other providers, look for their guidance on how to connect domains managed on external DNS services.

## Zone apex record

To create a zone apex record, use `@` for the record **Name**, as in the following example.

<Example>

| Type | Name | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `@`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>

<Render file="dns-record-steps" product="dns" params={{
    name: "your zone apex",
		example: "@"
}} />

## Domain redirects

Once you create a domain, you may want to route that traffic to other places.

For more guidance, refer to [Redirect domain to subdomain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#redirect-the-apex-domain-to-a-subdomain) or [Redirect one domain to another](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/redirect-domain/).

## Get free SSL certificates

While DNS is what communicates where your website or application can be reached, SSL/TLS is what enables websites and applications to establish connections in a secure way.

If your domain is not correctly covered by an SSL/TLS certificate, your visitors will find a warning on their browser stating that your website or application is not secure.

Cloudflare offers free, unshared, publicy trusted [Universal SSL certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) to all Cloudflare domains.
