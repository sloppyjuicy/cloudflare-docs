The **Proxy status** of a DNS record affects how Cloudflare treats incoming traffic to that record. Cloudflare recommends enabling our proxy for all `A`, `AAAA`, and `CNAME` records that are used for serving web traffic.

## Proxied records

### Protocol optimization

For proxied records, if your domain has [HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled](/speed/optimization/protocol/), Cloudflare automatically generates corresponding [HTTPS Service (HTTPS) records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#svcb-and-https) on the fly. HTTPS records allow you to provide a client with information about how it should connect to a server upfront, without the need of an initial plaintext HTTP connection.

:::note
Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 configurations also require that you have an SSL/TLS certificate served by Cloudflare. This means that disabling [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), for example, could impact this behavior.

### Limitations

## DNS-only records

When an `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` record is **DNS-only** — also known as being gray-clouded — DNS queries for these will resolve to the record's normal IP address.

In addition to potentially exposing your origin IP addresses to bad actors and [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), leaving your records as **DNS-only** means that Cloudflare cannot [optimize, cache, and protect](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) requests to your application or provide analytics on those requests.
