import { Example } from "~/components";

To rewrite all requests to `/news/2012/...` to `/archive/news/2012/...` you must add a reference to the content of the original URL. Create a new rewrite URL rule and define a dynamic URL path rewrite using [wildcard pattern parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/#wildcard-pattern-parameters):

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/news/2012/*`

**Then rewrite the path and/or query**
- **Target path**: `/news/2012/*`
- **Rewrite to**: `/archive/news/2012/${1}`

</Example>

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
