Refer to each linked section for details on creating each rule type.

## Turn on or off a rule

Select the three dots next to the rule, and then select **Enable** or **Disable** to turn the rule on or off.

## Edit a rule

To edit a rule, select the rule name. Alternatively, select the three dots menu > **Edit**.

## Delete a rule

To delete a rule, select the three dots menu > **Delete** next to the rule you want to remove. In the confirmation dialog that appears, select **Delete** to confirm and complete the operation.

## Order rules

Cloudflare evaluates each type of Transform Rules in list order, where rules are evaluated in the order they appear in the rules list. You can drag and drop rules into position to reorder them using the handle next to each rule.
