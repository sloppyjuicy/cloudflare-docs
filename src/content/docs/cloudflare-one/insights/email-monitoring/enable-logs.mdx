1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Analytics & Logs** > **Logpush**.
3. Select **Audit logs**.
4. Under **Configure logpush job**: 
  - **Job name**: Enter the job name.
  - **If logs match**: Select **Filtered logs**:
    - **Field**: Choose `ResourceType`.
    - **Operator**: Choose `starts with`.
    - **Value**: Enter `email_security`.  
5. Select **Submit**.

You can now view logs via the Cloudflare dashboard.
