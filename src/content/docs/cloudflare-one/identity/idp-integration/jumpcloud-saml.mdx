[JumpCloud](https://jumpcloud.com/#platform) provides SSO identity management. Cloudflare Access integrates with JumpCloud as a SAML identity provider.

The following steps are specific to setting up JumpCloud with Cloudflare Access. For more information on configuring JumpCloud SSO application, refer to the [JumpCloud documentation](https://jumpcloud.com/support/integrate-with-cloudflare).

## Set up Jumpcloud as a SAML provider

### 1. Create an SSO application in JumpCloud

1. In the [JumpCloud Admin Portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/#/home), go to **SSO Applications**.

2. Select **Add New Application**.

3. In the search bar, enter `Cloudflare` and select the **Cloudflare Access** application.

4. Select **Next**.

5. In **Display Label**, enter an application name.

6. Select **Save Application**.

7. Review the application summary and select **Configure Application**.

8. In the **SSO** tab, configure the following settings:
	1. In **IdP Entity ID**, enter your Cloudflare team domain:

		```txt
		https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/
		```
		You can find your team name in Zero Trust under **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

	2. Set both **SP Entity ID** and **ACS URL** to the following callback URL:

		```txt
		https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
		```
	3. (Optional) Configure SAML attributes that you want to send to Cloudflare Access.

	4. Scroll up to **JumpCloud Metadata** and select **Export Metadata**. Save this XML file for use in a [later step](#2-add-jumpcloud-to-zero-trust).

9. In the **User Groups** tab, [assign user groups](https://jumpcloud.com/support/get-started-applications-saml-sso#managing-employee-access-to-applications) to this application.

10. Select **Save**.

### 2. Add JumpCloud to Zero Trust

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.

2. Under **Login methods**, select **Add new**.

3. Select **SAML**.

4. Upload your JumpCloud XML metadata file.

5. (Optional) To enable SCIM, refer to [Synchronize users and groups](#synchronize-users-and-groups).

6. (Optional) Under **Optional configurations**, configure [additional SAML options](#optional-configurations).

7. Select **Save**.

You can now [test your connection](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/#test-idps-in-zero-trust) and create [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) based on the configured login method and SAML attributes.

## Synchronize users and groups

The JumpCloud integration allows you to synchronize user groups and automatically deprovision users using [SCIM](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/scim/).

### 1. Enable SCIM in Zero Trust

	params={{ idp: "JumpCloud"}}
/>

### 2. Configure SCIM in JumpCloud

1. In the [JumpCloud Admin Portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/#/home), go to **SSO Applications**.
2. Select the Cloudflare application that was created when you [Set up JumpCloud as a SAML provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/jumpcloud-saml/#set-up-jumpcloud-as-a-saml-provider).
3. Select the **SSO** tab.
3. To provision user groups, select **Include group attribute** and enter `groups`. The group attribute name has to exactly match `groups` or else it will be sent as a SAML attribute.
5. Select the **Identity Management** tab.
6. Make sure that **Enable management of User Groups and Group Membership in this application** is turned on.
7. Select **Configure**.
8. In the **Base URL** field, enter the **SCIM Endpoint** obtained from Zero Trust.
9. In the **Token Key** field, enter the **SCIM Secret** obtained from Zero Trust.
10. Select **Activate**. You will receive a confirmation that the Identity Management integration has been successfully verified.
11. Select **Save**.

### Provisioning attributes

Provisioning attributes define the user and group properties that JumpCloud will synchronize with Cloudflare Access. By default, JumpCloud will send the following attributes during a SCIM update event:

| JumpCloud user attribute| Cloudflare Access attribute |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `email` 					 | `email`            |
| `firstname`        | `givenName`        |
| `lastname`         | `surname`          |

| JumpCloud group attribute | Cloudflare Access attribute |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `name` 					   | `groups`            |
