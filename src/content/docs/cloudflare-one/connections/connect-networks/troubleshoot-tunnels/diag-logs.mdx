Cloudflare Tunnel generates a set of diagnostic logs that can be used to troubleshoot issues with `cloudflared`. A diagnostic report collects data from a single instance of `cloudflared` running on the local machine.

## Get diagnostic logs

The steps for getting diagnostic logs depend on your `cloudflared` deployment environment.

### Prerequisites

- `cloudflared` version 2024.12.2 or later installed on the host

### Host environment

These instructions apply to remotely-managed and locally-managed tunnels running directly on the host machine.

1. (Linux only) To include network diagnostics in the logs, allow the `cloudflared` user to create RAW and PACKET sockets without root permissions:

		```sh
		sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/traceroute && sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/traceroute
		```

		If you do not set `cap_net_raw`, then traceroute data will be unavailable.

2. Get diagnostic logs:

		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag
		```

		If multiple instances of `cloudflared` are running on the same host, specify the [metrics server IP and port](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/#check-the-metrics-server-address) for the instance you want to diagnose. For example:

		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag --metrics 127.0.0.1:20241
		```

This command will output the status of each diagnostic task and place a `cloudflared-diag-YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.zip` file in your working directory.

### Docker

`cloudflared` reads diagnostic data from the [tunnel metrics server](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/). To get diagnostic logs, the metrics server must be exposed from the Docker container and reachable from the host machine.

1. Determine the [metrics server port](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/#default-metrics-server-address) for the `cloudflared` instance running in Docker.

2. Ensure the container is deployed with port forwarding enabled. The diagnostic feature will request information from the Docker instance using local port `20241`, therefore you should forward port `20241` to the container port obtained in Step 1:

		```sh
		docker run -d -p 20241:<metrics_port> docker.io/cloudflare/cloudflared tunnel ...
		```

3. Verify that you can reach the metrics server address from the Docker host environment:

		```sh
		curl localhost:20241/diag/tunnel
		```

		This command should return a JSON:
		```json
		{
			"tunnelID": "ef96b330-a7f5-4bce-a00e-827ce5be077f",
			"connectorID": "d236670a-9f74-422f-adf1-030f5c5f0523",
			"connections": [
				{ "isConnected": true, "protocol": 1, "edgeAddress": "198.41.192.167"},
				{"isConnected": true, "protocol": 1, "edgeAddress": "198.41.200.113", "index": 1},
				{"isConnected": true, "protocol": 1, "edgeAddress": "198.41.192.47", "index": 2},
				{"isConnected": true, "protocol": 1, "edgeAddress": "198.41.200.73", "index": 3}
			],
			"icmp_sources": ["192.168.1.243", "fe80::c59:bd4a:e815:ed6"]
		}
		```

4. Run the diagnostic using the Docker container ID:

		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag --diag-container-id=<containerID>
		```

		Alternatively, you can specify the container's name instead of its ID:
		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag --diag-container-id=<containerName>
		```

		Running the diagnostic command with the container ID allows `cloudflared` to collect information from the Docker environment such as logs and container details.

This command will output the status of each diagnostic task and place a `cloudflared-diag-YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.zip` file in your working directory.

### Kubernetes

The diagnostic feature will request data from the [tunnel metrics server](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/) using ports `20241` to `20245`. You will need to use port forwarding to allow the local `cloudflared` instance to connect to the metrics server on one of these ports.

1. Determine the tunnel's [metrics server port](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/#default-metrics-server-address).

2. Enable port forwarding:

		```sh
		kubectl port-forward <pod> <diagnostic_port>:<metrics_port>
		```

		- `<pod>`: Name of the pod where the tunnel is running
		- `<diagnostic_port>` is any local port in the range `20241` to `20245`.
		- `<metrics_port>` is the Kubernetes pod port for the `cloudflared` instance you want to diagnose (obtained in Step 1).

		For example, if you set the metrics server address to `0.0.0.0:12345`:

		```sh
		kubectl port-forward cloudflared-6d4897585b-r8kfz 20244:12345
		```
		Connections made to local port `20244` are forwarded to port `12345` of the pod that is running the tunnel.

3. Run the diagnostic:

		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag --diag-pod-id=<podID>
		```

		If the pod has multiple applications/services running and `cloudflared` is not the first in the pod, you must specify either the container ID or name:

		```sh
		cloudflared tunnel diag --diag-pod-id=<podID> --diag-container-id=<containerName>
		```

This command will output the status of each diagnostic task and place a `cloudflared-diag-YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.zip` file in your working directory.

## cloudflared-diag files

The `cloudflared-diag-YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.zip` archive contains the files listed below. The data in a file either applies to the `cloudflared` instance being diagnosed (`diagnosee`) or the instance that triggered the diagnosis (`diagnoser`). For example, if your tunnel is running in a Docker container, the diagnosee is the Docker instance and the diagnoser is the host instance.

| File name  | Description | Instance |
| -| - | - |
| `cli-configuration.json`| [Tunnel run parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-run-parameters/) used when starting the tunnel | diagnosee|
| `cloudflared_logs.txt` | [Tunnel log file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/logs/)[^1]  | diagnosee|
| `configuration.json` | Tunnel configuration parameters | diagnosee|
| `goroutine.pprof` | goroutine profile made available by `pprof` | diagnosee|
| `heap.pprof` | 	heap profile made available by `pprof`| diagnosee|
| `metrics.txt` | Snapshot of [Tunnel metrics](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/#available-metrics) at the time of diagnosis | diagnosee|
| `network.txt` | JSON traceroutes to Cloudflare's global network using IPv4 and IPv6 | diagnoser|
| `raw-network.txt` | Raw traceroutes to Cloudflare's global network using IPv4 and IPv6 | diagnoser|
| `systeminformation.json` | Operating system information and resource usage | diagnosee|
| `task-result.json` | Result of each diagnostic task | diagnoser |
| `tunnelstate.json` | Tunnel connections at the time of diagnosis| diagnosee|

[^1]: If the log file is blank, you may need to [set `--loglevel` to `debug`](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/logs/#view-logs-on-the-server) when you start the tunnel. The `--loglevel` parameter is only required if you ran the tunnel from the CLI using a `cloudflared tunnel run` command. It is not necessary if the tunnel runs as a Linux/macOS service or runs in Docker/Kubernetes.
