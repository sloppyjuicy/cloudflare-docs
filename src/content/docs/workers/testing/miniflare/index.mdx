:::caution
This documentation describes the Miniflare API, which is only relevant for advanced use cases. Instead, most users should use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler) to build, run & deploy their Workers locally
:::

**Miniflare** is a simulator for developing and testing
[**Cloudflare Workers**](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). It's written in
TypeScript, and runs your code in a sandbox implementing Workers' runtime APIs.

- ðŸŽ‰ **Fun:** develop Workers easily with detailed logging, file watching and
  pretty error pages supporting source maps.
- ðŸ”‹ **Full-featured:** supports most Workers features, including KV, Durable
  Objects, WebSockets, modules and more.
- âš¡ **Fully-local:** test and develop Workers without an Internet connection.

These docs primarily cover Miniflare specific things. For more information on
runtime APIs, refer to the
[Cloudflare Workers docs](/workers).

If you find something that doesn't behave as it does in the production Workers
environment (and this difference isn't documented), or something's wrong in
these docs, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).
