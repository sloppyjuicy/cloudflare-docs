description: Opt into a specific features of the Workers runtime for your Workers project.

import { CompatibilityFlags } from "~/components";

Compatibility flags enable specific features. They can be useful if you want to help the Workers team test upcoming changes that are not yet enabled by default, or if you need to hold back a change that your code depends on but still want to apply other compatibility changes.

Compatibility flags will often have a date in which they are enabled by default, and so, by specifying a [`compatibility_date`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates) for your Worker, you can quickly enable all of these various compatibility flags up to, and including, that date.

## Setting compatibility flags

You may provide a list of `compatibility_flags`, which enable or disable specific changes.

#### Via Wrangler

Compatibility flags can be set in a Worker's [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file.

This example enables the specific flag `formdata_parser_supports_files`, which is described [below](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#formdata-parsing-supports-file). As of the specified date, `2021-09-14`, this particular flag was not yet enabled by default, but, by specifying it in `compatibility_flags`, we can enable it anyway. `compatibility_flags` can also be used to disable changes that became the default in the past.

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# Opt into backwards-incompatible changes through September 14, 2021.
compatibility_date = "2021-09-14"
# Also opt into an upcoming fix to the FormData API.
compatibility_flags = [ "formdata_parser_supports_files" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

#### Via the Cloudflare Dashboard

Compatibility flags can be updated in the Workers settings on the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

#### Via the Cloudflare API

Compatibility flags can be set when uploading a Worker using the [Workers Script API](/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/) or [Workers Versions API](/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/subresources/versions/methods/create/) in the request body's `metadata` field.

## Node.js compatibility flag

:::note
You can opt into improved Node.js compatibility by using `nodejs_compat_v2` instead of `nodejs_compat`. This provides the functionality of `nodejs_compat`, but
additionally you can import Node.js modules without the `node:` prefix and use polyfilled Node.js modules and globals that are not available with `nodejs_compat`.

On September 23, 2024, `nodejs_compat` will use the improved Node.js compatibility currently enabled with `nodejs_compat_v2`. This will require updating your
compatibility_date to 2024-09-23 or later.
:::

A [growing subset](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) of Node.js APIs are available directly as [Runtime APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs), with no need to add polyfills to your own code. To enable these APIs in your Worker, add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your `wrangler.toml`:



<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

As additional Node.js APIs are added, they will be made available under the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag. Unlike most other compatibility flags, we do not expect the `nodejs_compat` to become active by default at a future date.

The Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` API is a particularly useful feature for Workers. To enable only the `AsyncLocalStorage` API, use the `nodejs_als` compatibility flag.



<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_als" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

## Flags history

Newest flags are listed first.

## Experimental flags

These flags can be enabled via `compatibility_flags`, but are not yet scheduled to become default on any particular date.
