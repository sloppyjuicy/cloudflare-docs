**Cloudflare Apps is deprecated and will be discontinued August 31, 2024.**

After August 31, 2024, we will be automatically uninstalling installed apps from your Cloudflare zone(s), the only exception being the [Datadome app](https://datadome.co/). This will not impact Cloudflare's first-party services running on your zones.

After December 20, 2024, DataDome will also be uninstalled from your Cloudflare zone(s). We encourage all customers who have configured DataDome through Cloudflare Apps to instead [configure DataDome through the Cloudflare Worker installation](https://docs.datadome.co/docs/cloudflare-worker).

We understand that uninstalling apps might be disruptive. To address any potential issues, please review and [remove](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-apps/removing-cloudflare-apps/) apps installed on your zones through the Cloudflare dashboard.

For any questions about the deprecation or support requests, reach out to apps-marketplace-support@cloudflare.com.

We will be creating a new Apps experience. If you are interested, leave us feedback and sign up in [this form](https://forms.gle/sHxVMoQzZpTtuJak9).
