## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid credentials and network access.

### Azure Portal

#### Public access networking

To connect to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance using public Internet connectivity:

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select the instance you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Expand **Settings** > **Networking** > ensure **Public access** is enabled > in **Firewall rules** add `0.0.0.0` as **Start IP address** and `255.255.255.255` as **End IP address**.
3. Select **Save** to persist your changes.
4. Select **Overview** from the sidebar and note down the **Server name** of your instance.

With the username, password, server name, and database name (default: `postgres`), you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

#### Private access networking

To connect to a private Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance, refer to [Connect to a private database using Tunnel](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-private-database/).
