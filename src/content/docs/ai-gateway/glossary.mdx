AI Gateway supports a variety of headers to help you configure, customize, and manage your API requests. This page provides a complete list of all supported headers, along with a short description

## Configuration hierarchy

Settings in AI Gateway can be configured at three levels: **Provider**, **Request**, and **Gateway**. Since the same settings can be configured in multiple locations, the following hierarchy determines which value is applied:

1. **Provider-level headers**:
   Relevant only when using the [Universal Endpoint](/ai-gateway/providers/universal/), these headers take precedence over all other configurations.
2. **Request-level headers**:
   Apply if no provider-level headers are set.
3. **Gateway-level settings**:
   Act as the default if no headers are set at the provider or request levels.

This hierarchy ensures consistent behavior, prioritizing the most specific configurations. Use provider-level and request-level headers for more fine-tuned control, and gateway settings for general defaults.
