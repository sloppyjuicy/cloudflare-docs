<sup>1</sup> Bucket management operations include creating, deleting, listing,
and configuring buckets. This limit does _not_ apply to reading or writing objects to a bucket.
<br /> <sup>2</sup> The object size limit is 5 GiB less than 5 TiB, so 4.995
TiB.
<br /> <sup>3</sup> The max upload size is 5 MiB less than 5 GiB, so 4.995 GiB.
<br /> <sup>4</sup> Max upload size applies to uploading a file via one request,
uploading a part of a multipart upload, or copying into a part of a multipart
upload. If you have a Worker, its inbound request size is constrained by
[Workers request limits](/workers/platform/limits#request-limits). The max
upload size limit does not apply to subrequests.
<br />

Limits specified in MiB (mebibyte), GiB (gibibyte), or TiB (tebibyte) are storage units of measurement based on base-2. 1 GiB (gibibyte) is equivalent to 2<sup>30</sup> bytes (or 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes). This is distinct from 1 GB (gigabyte), which is 10<sup>9</sup> bytes (or 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes).

## Rate limiting on managed public buckets through `r2.dev`

Managed public bucket access through an `r2.dev` subdomain is not intended for production usage and has a variable rate limit applied to it. The `r2.dev` endpoint for your bucket is designed to enable testing.

* If you exceed the rate limit (hundreds of requests/second), requests to your `r2.dev` endpoint will be temporarily throttled and you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
* Bandwidth (throughput) may also be throttled when using the `r2.dev` endpoint.

For production use cases, connect a [custom domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains) to your bucket. Custom domains allow you to serve content from a domain you control (for example, `assets.example.com`), configure fine-grained caching, set up redirect and rewrite rules, mutate content via [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/), and get detailed URL-level analytics for content served from your R2 bucket.
