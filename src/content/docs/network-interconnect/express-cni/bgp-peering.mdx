title: BGP peering
---

Magic WAN and Magic Transit customers can use the Cloudflare dashboard to configure and manage BGP peering between their networks and their Magic routing table when using a Direct CNI on-ramp.

Using BGP peering with a CNI allows customers to:
- Automate the process of adding or removing networks and subnets.
- Take advantage of failure detection and session recovery features.

With this functionality, customers can:
- Establish an eBGP session between their devices and the Magic WAN / Magic Transit service when connected via CNI.
- Secure the session by MD5 authentication to prevent misconfigurations.
- Exchange routes dynamically between their devices and their Magic routing table.

Refer to [Magic WAN BGP peering](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/bgp-peering/) or [Magic Transit BGP peering](/magic-transit/how-to/bgp-peering/) to learn more about this feature and how to set it up.
