		asnProduct: "<br /> Magic Transit customers should also be aware of the following: <br /> <ul><li>The Cloudflare side ASN will never be exposed in <code>AS_PATH</code> of anycast announcements from the Cloudflare edge. In those announcements, Cloudflare will always use the Cloudflare ASN of <code>13335</code> optionally prepended with a bring-your-own ASN as described in [Cloudflare ASN vs. your own ASN](/magic-transit/how-to/advertise-prefixes/#cloudflare-asn-vs-your-own-asn)</li><li>The customer device ASN can be a private ASN or the ASN they are using for Magic Transit anycast announcements at the edge: this has no impact on the ASN for the anycast announced prefix at the edge of the Cloudflare global network.</li></ul>",
		mtLimitations: "<br /> For Magic Transit customers, BGP with the Magic routing table is separated from the announcement of anycast prefixes at the Cloudflare edge. Anycast withdrawal must be controlled with existing methods documented in [Advertise prefixes](/magic-transit/how-to/advertise-prefixes/).",
