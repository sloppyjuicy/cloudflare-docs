You can bind and trigger Workflows from [Pages Functions](/pages/functions/) by deploying a Workers project with your Workflow definition and then invoking that Worker using [service bindings](/pages/functions/bindings/#service-bindings) or a standard `fetch()` call.

:::note

You will need to deploy your Workflow as a standalone Workers project first before your Pages Function can call it. If you have not yet deployed a Workflow, refer to the Workflows [get started guide](/workflows/get-started/guide/).

:::

### Use Service Bindings

[Service Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) allow you to call a Worker from another Worker or a Pages Function without needing to expose it directly.

To do this, you will need to:

1. Deploy your Workflow in a Worker
2. Create a Service Binding to that Worker in your Pages project
3. Call the Worker remotely using the binding

For example, if you have a Worker called `workflows-starter`, you would create a new Service Binding in your Pages project as follows, ensuring that the `service` name matches the name of the Worker your Workflow is defined in:

<WranglerConfig>
```toml
services = [
  { binding = "WORKFLOW_SERVICE", service = "workflows-starter" }
]
```
</WranglerConfig>

Your Worker can expose a specific method (or methods) that only other Workers or Pages Functions can call over the Service Binding.

In the following example, we expose a specific `createInstance` method that accepts our `Payload` and returns the [`InstanceStatus`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#instancestatus) from the Workflows API:

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

interface Env {
	MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}

type Payload = {
	hello: string;
}

export default class WorkflowsService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  // Currently, entrypoints without a named handler are not supported
  async fetch() { return new Response(null, {status: 404}); }

  async createInstance(payload: Payload) {
    let instance = await this.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
    	params: payload
    });

    return Response.json({
      id: instance.id,
      details: await instance.status(),
    });
  }
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

Your Pages Function would resemble the following:

<TypeScriptExample filename="functions/request.ts">
```ts
interface Env {
	WORKFLOW_SERVICE: Service;
}

export const onRequest: PagesFunction<Env> = async (context) => {
	// This payload could be anything from within your app or from your frontend
	let payload = {"hello": "world"}
	return context.env.WORKFLOWS_SERVICE.createInstance(payload)
};
```
</TypeScriptExample>

To learn more about binding to resources from Pages Functions, including how to bind via the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to the [bindings documentation for Pages Functions](/pages/functions/bindings/#service-bindings).

### Using fetch

:::note "Service Bindings vs. fetch"

We recommend using [Service Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) when calling a Worker in your own account.

Service Bindings don't require you to expose a public endpoint from your Worker, don't require you to configure authentication, and allow you to call methods on your Worker directly, avoiding the overhead of managing HTTP requests and responses.

:::

An alternative to setting up a Service Binding is to call the Worker over HTTP by using the Workflows [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflow) to `create` a new Workflow instance for each incoming HTTP call to the Worker:

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
// This is in the same file as your Workflow definition
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
    	params: payload
    });
    return Response.json({
      id: instance.id,
      details: await instance.status(),
    });
  },
};
```
</TypeScriptExample>

Your [Pages Function](/pages/functions/get-started/) can then make a regular `fetch` call to the Worker:

<TypeScriptExample filename="functions/request.ts">
```ts
export const onRequest: PagesFunction<Env> = async (context) => {
	// Other code
	let payload = {"hello": "world"}
  const instanceStatus = await fetch("https://YOUR_WORKER.workers.dev/", {
  	method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(payload) // Send a payload for our Worker to pass to the Workflow
  })

  return Response.json(instanceStatus);
};
```
</TypeScriptExample>

You can also choose to authenticate these requests by passing a shared secret in a header and validating that in your Worker.
