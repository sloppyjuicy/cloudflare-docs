Cloudflare partners with many [SaaS providers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/provider-guides/) to extend our performance and security benefits to your website.

If you are a SaaS customer, you can take this process a step further by managing your own zone on Cloudflare. This setup - known as **Orange-to-Orange (O2O)** - allows you to benefit from your provider's setup but still customize how Cloudflare treats incoming traffic to your zone.
