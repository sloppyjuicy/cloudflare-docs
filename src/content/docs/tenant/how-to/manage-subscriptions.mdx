Once your customer has a zone provisioned, you can add zone and account-level subscriptions.

## Zone subscriptions

### Create zone subscription

<Render file="create-zone-subscription" />

### Get zone subscription details

To get the details of a zone subscription, send a [`GET`](/api/resources/zones/subresources/subscriptions/methods/get/) request to the `/zones/<ZONE_ID>/subscription` endpoint.

### Update zone subscription

To update a subscription on a zone, typically used to update an existing subscription's 'component\_values' or to downgrade a zone's subscription, send a [`PUT`](/api/resources/zones/subresources/subscriptions/methods/update/) request to the `/zones/<ZONE_ID>/subscription` endpoint.

## Account subscriptions

Depending on your agreement, you may be allowed to resell other add-on services. These are provisioned as account-level subscriptions.

### Create account subscription

<Render file="create-account-subscription" />

### Get account subscription details

To get all subscriptions for an account, send a [`GET`](/api/resources/accounts/subresources/subscriptions/methods/get/) request to the `/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/subscriptions` endpoint.

### Update account subscription

To update a subscription on an account, send a [`PUT`](/api/resources/accounts/subresources/subscriptions/methods/update/) request to the `/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` endpoint.

### Delete account subscription

To delete a subscription on an account, send a [`DELETE`](/api/resources/accounts/subresources/subscriptions/methods/delete/) request to the `/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` endpoint.
