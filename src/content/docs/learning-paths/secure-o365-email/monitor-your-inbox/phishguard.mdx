[PhishGuard](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-guard/) serves as an extension of your Security Operations team with dedicated Email Security technical resources providing real-time monitoring of your email environment. The Active Defense Service provides:

- Customized notification and responses for fraud and insider threats.
- Reclassification of messages if the disposition is incorrect.
- PhishGuard monitors and reviews Suspicious email traffic. 
- Quarantine and auto-move of identified threats.
- Tailored threat hunting for your email environment.
- Custom detections.

As a PhishGuard customer, the following service offerings should be enabled: 

- Escalation contacts must be configured in the Email Security dashboard: This allows for email reports to be delivered regarding high risk items identified and responded to by the team.
- Auto-moves should be enabled and configured for quarantine of identified items: Malicious should be prioritized, but configuring Spam for a move to junk/trash or even soft delete may also be highly useful to the client.
