To access an overview of your account, the total number of emails processed, a breakdown of types of threads detected, and other useful information:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust.](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select **Email Security**.

Under **Email Security**, select **Monitoring**.

The dashboard will display the following metrics:

- Email activity
- [Disposition evaluation](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/)
- Detection details
- [Impersonations](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/)
- [Phish submissions](/cloudflare-one/insights/email-monitoring/phish-submissions/)
- [Auto-move events](/cloudflare-one/email-security/auto-moves/)
- [Detection settings metrics](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/)

Email activity aggregates statistics about emails scanned and dispositions assigned (the number of email flagged due to a detection) within a given timeframe.

To view the live number of email scanned and dispositions scanned, enable **Live mode**.
