To create your Email Security account, you will need the alphanumeric string on the URL when logged in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

If you do not have a Cloudflare account, you can create one for free by referring to the [Cloudflare sign-up page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).

Once you have created your account, your account team will create an Email Security account for you. 

To establish your tenant, you will need the following information:

- Average monthly inbound message volume
- Number of active email users
- At least one domain
- Admin email address
