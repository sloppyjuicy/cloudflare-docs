Now that you have set up your email environment, you can enable auto-move events.

:::caution
Ensure you have completed the previous modules before enabling auto-moves.
:::

Auto-move events are events where emails are automatically moved to different inboxes based on the disposition assigned to them by Email Security.

When you set up auto-moves, you can move messages manually or set up automatic moves to send messages matching certain [dispositions](/learning-paths/secure-o365-email/enable-auto-moves/email-dispositions/) to specific folders within a user's mailbox. 

You can also enable Post Delivery Response and Phish Submission Response to re-evaluate messages previously delivered against new information gathered by Email Security. Scanned emails that were previously delivered and now match this new phishing information will be moved.
