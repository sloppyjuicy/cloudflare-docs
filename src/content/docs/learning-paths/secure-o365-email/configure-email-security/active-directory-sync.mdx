Directories are folders to store user data. Email Security allows you to manage directories from the Cloudflare dashboard.

To manage a Microsoft directory:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust ](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Directories**.
4. Under **Directory name**, select **MS directory**.
5. From here, you can manage **Groups** or **Users** directories.

Email Security allows you to view and manage your groups directory and their [impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/). 
When a group is added to the registry, all members are registered by default.

To manage your group directory, on the **MS directory** page, select **Groups**.

To add a single group to the registry:

1. Select the group name you want to add.
2. Select the three dots > **Add to registry**.

To add multiple groups to the registry at once:

1. Select the group names you want to add to the registry.
2. Select the **Action** dropdown list.
3. Select **Add to registry**.

In addition, Email Security allows you to:

- [Remove groups from the registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-ms-directories/manage-groups-directory/#remove-groups-from-registry).
- [Filter the impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-ms-directories/manage-groups-directory/#filter-impersonation-registry).
- [Manage users in your directory](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/manage-ms-directories/manage-users-directory/).
