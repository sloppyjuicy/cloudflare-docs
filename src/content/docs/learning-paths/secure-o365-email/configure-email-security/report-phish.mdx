Before deploying Email Security to production, you will have to consider reporting any phishing attacks, evaluating which disposition to assign a specific message, and using different screen criteria to search through your inbox.

PhishNet is an add-in button that helps users to submit phish samples missed by Email Security detection. 

To set up PhishNet O365:

1. Log in to the Microsoft admin panel. Go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**.
2. Select **Upload custom apps**.
3. Choose **Provide link to manifest file** and paste the the following URL:

```txt
https://phishnet-o365.area1cloudflare-webapps.workers.dev?clientId=ODcxNDA0MjMyNDM3NTA4NjQwNDk1Mzc3MDIxNzE0OTcxNTg0Njk5NDEyOTE2NDU5ODQyNjU5NzYzNjYyNDQ3NjEwMzIxODEyMDk1NQ
```
4. Verify and complete the wizard.
