Follow these steps to onboard your website or application to Cloudflare. Once your domain is [active](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/#active), your web traffic will [proxy through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-reverse-proxy), which speeds up and protects websites and services on your domain.

Cloudflare will become the primary [DNS provider](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-dns-provider) for your domain, meaning your [DNS records](/dns/concepts/#dns-records) are managed at Cloudflare, and we authoritatively answer all DNS queries.

:::note


These instructions are tailored to customers using a [full DNS setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup) (the most common configuration). If you are using a [partial setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) or [secondary setup](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/), your onboarding process will be different.


:::

## Prerequisites

To onboard a website or application to Cloudflare, you need to own the domain name (`example.com`).

If you do not already own a domain and plan to use Cloudflare for your [authoritative DNS](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), we highly recommend purchasing your domain name through [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/get-started/register-domain/). This simplifies your setup process by automatically using Cloudflare for authoritative DNS.

## 1. Add site in Cloudflare

<Render file="add-site" product="fundamentals" />

## 2. Update nameservers

<Render file="update-nameservers" product="fundamentals" />

## 3. Complete SSL/TLS setup

To prevent insecure connections and visitor browser errors, [make sure you have SSL/TLS protection](/ssl/get-started/).

## 4. Go beyond the basics

Many Cloudflare services will automatically protect and speed up your web traffic once your nameservers are updated. To customize how we process your traffic and to get more out of Cloudflare, refer to our [basic tasks](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/).
