Below you will find answers to our most commonly asked questions. If you cannot find the answer you are looking for, refer to the [Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com) to explore additional resources.

##### Uncaught (in response) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fetch')

Make sure that you are passing your Browser binding to the `puppeteer.launch` api and that you have [Workers for Platforms Paid plan](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/pricing/).

##### Will browser rendering bypass Cloudflare's Bot Protection?

Browser rendering requests are always identified as bots by Cloudflare.

If you are trying to **scan** your **own zone**, you can create a [WAF skip rule](/waf/custom-rules/skip/) to bypass the bot protection using a header or a custom user agent.

## Puppeteer

##### Code generation from strings disallowed for this context while using an Xpath selector

Currently it's not possible to use Xpath to select elements since this poses a security risk to Workers.

As an alternative try to use a css selector or `page.evaluate` for example:

```ts
const innerHtml = await page.evaluate(() => {
	return (
		// @ts-ignore this runs on browser context
		new XPathEvaluator()
			.createExpression("/html/body/div/h1")
			// @ts-ignore this runs on browser context
			.evaluate(document, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE).singleNodeValue
			.innerHTML
	);
});
```

:::note

Keep in mind that `page.evaluate` can only return primitive types like strings, numbers, etc.

Returning an `HTMLElement` will not work.
