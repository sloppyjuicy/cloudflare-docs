title: Juniper Networks SRX Series Firewalls
---

This tutorial provides information and examples of how to configure Juniper Networks SRX Series Firewalls with Magic WAN.

The configuration settings in this document are based on JUNOS 23.4R2.13.

## Prerequisites

Confirm that you have two Cloudflare anycast IPs allocated to your account. You will establish IPsec tunnels to the two anycast IPs irrespective of the location of your Juniper SRX devices (from now on referred to as endpoint) — traffic will be naturally attracted to the closest Cloudflare colocation facility via BGP anycast.

Cloudflare recommends that customers configure two IPsec tunnels (one to each of the two anycast IPs allocated to you Cloudflare account) per Internet service provider per endpoint. This provides tunnel redundancy.

Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) ensures traffic is load-balanced across the tunnels, and you can control traffic steering across the tunnels through route prioritization.

Cloudflare supports route-based site-to-site IPsec tunnels, which require the creation of virtual tunnel interfaces (VTIs). We recommend you select one subnet per Magic IPsec tunnel with either a `/30` or `/31` netmask.

Using a `/31` netmask is a more efficient use of IP addresses as it doubles the number of available subnets compared to a `/30`netmask. This is possible because with a `/31`netmask there is no need to reserve IP addresses for the subnet and broadcast addresses, as there would be if you opt to use a `/30` netmask. Additional details can be found in [RFC 3021 - Using 31-Bit Prefixes on IPv4 Point-to-Point Links](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3021).

## Cloudflare Magic WAN configuration

This section of the document will cover the configuration of:

- Magic IPsec tunnels
- Magic static routes

### Magic WAN topology

This documentation assumes there are two locations connected via Magic WAN:

| Site | Local/Remote | Security Zone | Subnet        |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| A    | Local        | trust         | `10.1.20.0/24`  |
| B    | Remote       | Cloudflare    | `10.1.100.0/24` |

### Magic IPsec tunnels

1. Start by [creating the IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/#add-tunnels) in the Cloudflare dashboard with the following values:
	- **Tunnel name**: Up to 15 characters (no spaces).
	- **Description** (Optional).
	- **Interface address**: This is the Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI = `st0.x`) RFC 1918 address — the IP address specified in this dialog box is the address on the Cloudflare side of the tunnel.
	- **Customer endpoint**: Specify the Internet IP address on the untrust side of the SRX firewall.
	- **Cloudflare endpoint**: One of the two Cloudflare anycast IP addresses.
	- **Pre-shared key**: Choose **Add pre-shared key later**.
2. Select **Add IPsec Tunnel** and fill in the values for the second tunnel to the same Juniper SRX:
	- Ensure you use a unique RFC 1918 IP address for the Interface Address (`/31` or `/30`).
	- Once again, specify the Internet IP address on the untrust side of the SRX firewall for the **Customer Endpoint**.
	- The **Cloudflare Endpoint** for the second tunnel will be the second Cloudflare anycast IP provisioned for your account.
3. Select **Add Tunnels**. We also recommend selecting **Test Tunnels** to ensure that the settings do not conflict with any other tunnels defined in your account and that you specified the correct anycast IP addresses.
4. You will see a warning indicator next to the tunnel names after creating them because we chose to add a pre-shared key later. This is expected behavior and indicates that a pre-shared key has not been generated yet for the associated tunnel.
5. Select **Edit** next to one of the tunnels to generate a pre-shared key.
6. Select **Generate a new pre-shared key** > **Update and generate a pre-shared key**. Make a note of the pre-shared key and store it somewhere safe.
	:::note
	You can update the pre-shared key at any time by repeating this step. Just make sure to add the new value of the new pre-shared key to the corresponding tunnel configuration on the Juniper device.
	:::
7. Repeat the previous step for the second tunnel.
8. Expand the first tunnel's properties and note the **Tunnel ID** and **FQDN ID** values.
9. Repeat the previous steps for the second tunnel.
	:::note
	The **Tunnel ID** and **FQDN ID** values are unique per tunnel and remain unchanged unless you delete and recreate the tunnel. Generating a new Pre-Shared Key will not change the values.
	:::

### Magic static routes

Refer to the Magic WAN Topology section above for more details on the IP subnet scheme.

[Magic static routes](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-static-routes/) effectively tell Magic WAN which tunnels to route traffic destined for a given Magic WAN site.

Since two tunnels are configured to each endpoint, it is necessary to configure two static routes.

Cloudflare leverages [equal-cost multi-path](/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/) routing to control traffic steering across the tunnels. The default priority for each route is 100 — traffic will be load-balanced across the two tunnels equally via ECMP. You can modify the priorities as needed, however best practices dictate leaving the default values in place.

1. Create a static route with the following values. Make sure you select the first tunnel in **Tunnel/Next hop**:
	- **Description:** The description for the static route assigned to your first tunnel.
	- **Prefix**: Enter the destination subnet for which this route is intended. For this example, it is `10.1.20.0/24` as stated above.
	- **Tunnel/Next hop**: Choose your first tunnel from the drop-down menu.
	- **Priority**: The default value is `100`.
	- **Region code**: Leave set to **All Regions** unless otherwise specified.
2. Select **Add Static Route** to add a second route for the same subnet. Make sure the second tunnel is selected in **Tunnel/Next hop**.
3. Select **Test Routes** to ensure the settings are accepted, then select **Add Routes**.
4. Confirm the routes were added correctly in **Magic WAN** > **Configuration** > **Static Routes**.

## Juniper SRX configuration

There may be some differences in the syntax of the commands in the version on your SRX devices. However, the principles are the same. Refer to the Juniper product documentation for more information.

The interface naming convention for VTI interfaces (also known as Secure Tunnel Interfaces) in Junos is `st0.x`.

[Secure Tunnel Interface in a Virtual Router - Juniper IPsec VPN User Guide](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/vpn-ipsec/topics/topic-map/security-secure-tunnel-interface-in-a-virtual-router.html)

The following elements will be configured on the Juniper SRX firewall(s):

- Ensure the LAN interface is in the `trust` zone
- Add virtual tunnel Interfaces (`st0.0` and `st0.1`)
- Assign tunnel interfaces to the `cloudflare` security zone
- Allow required protocols to both the tunnel and untrust security zones
- IKE configuration
- IPsec configuration
- Policy-based routing (filter-based forwarding)
- Security policies

### Tunnel interfaces

1. Add two tunnel interfaces:

```txt
set interfaces st0 unit 0 family inet address 10.252.2.21/31
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet address 10.252.2.23/31
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration interfaces st0
```
```txt output
unit 0 {
    family inet {
        address 10.252.2.21/31;
    }
}
unit 1 {
    family inet {
        address 10.252.2.23/31;
    }
}
```

### Security Zone (Cloudflare) - tunnel interfaces

Define a security zone and add both tunnel interfaces to it. At a minimum, the interfaces should allow `ping`, but this zone only contains point-to-point connections between the firewall and the customer network namespace. Setting it to `all` for system-services and protocols should be fine.

```txt
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services all
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.0 host-inbound-traffic
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.1 host-inbound-traffic system-services all
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.1 host-inbound-traffic
```

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security zones security-zone cloudflare
```
```txt output
interfaces {
	st0.0 {
		host-inbound-traffic {
			system-services {
				all;
			}
			protocols {
				all;
			}
		}
	}
	st0.1 {
		host-inbound-traffic {
			system-services {
				all;
			}
			protocols {
				all;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Security zone (untrust) - `host-inbound-traffic`

Add `ping` and `ike` to the security zone containing the external interface used to establish the IPsec tunnels to Cloudflare.

```txt
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ike
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security zones security-zone untrust
```
```txt output
screen untrust-screen;
interfaces {
    ge-0/0/0.0 {
        host-inbound-traffic {
            system-services {
                ike;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### IKE - Phase 1

#### IKE proposal

Add an IKE proposal that specifies the [Phase 1 Configuration Parameters](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters):

```txt
set security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop authentication-method pre-shared-keys
set security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop dh-group group20
set security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop authentication-algorithm sha-256
set security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop lifetime-seconds 86400
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike proposal cf_magic_wan_ike_prop
```
```txt output
authentication-method pre-shared-keys;
dh-group group20;
authentication-algorithm sha-256;
encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc;
lifetime-seconds 86400;
```

#### IKE policies

Define two IKE policies - one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels:

***Tunnel 1 (SRX300_IPSEC_01)**

```txt
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol mode main
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol proposals cf_magic_wan_ike_prop
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$GRjPTF<REDACTED>WZUjHPT"
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol
```
```txt output
mode main;
proposals cf_magic_wan_ike_prop;
pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$GRjPTF<REDACTED>WZUjHPT"; ## SECRET-DATA
```

**Tunnel 2 (SRX300_IPSEC_02)**

```txt
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol mode main
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol proposals cf_magic_wan_ike_prop
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$f536tp<REDACTED>SrH.fT/9Lx7-bY"
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol
```
```txt output
mode main;
proposals cf_magic_wan_ike_prop;
pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$f536tp<REDACTED>SrH.fT/9Lx7-bY"; ## SECRET-DATA
```

#### IKE gateways

Define two IKE gateways — one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels. In the examples below, note the use of the **FQDN ID** value obtained from the Cloudflare dashboard in the `local-identity` hostname setting.

**Tunnel 1 (SRX300_IPSEC_01)**

```txt
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01 ike-policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01 address 162.159.68.68
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01 local-identity hostname 1663e5e70<REDACTED>6555.ipsec.cloudflare.com
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01 external-interface ge-0/0/0.0
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01 version v2-only
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01
```
```txt output
ike-policy cf_magic_wan_tun_01_pol;
address 162.159.68.68;
local-identity hostname 1663e5e70<REDACTED>6555.ipsec.cloudflare.com;
external-interface ge-0/0/0.0;
version v2-only;
```

**Tunnel 2 (SRX300_IPSEC_02)**

```txt
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02 ike-policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02 address 172.64.244.68
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02 local-identity hostname b5ee5303<REDACTED>6555.ipsec.cloudflare.com
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02 external-interface ge-0/0/0.0
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02 version v2-only
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02
```
```txt output
ike-policy cf_magic_wan_tun_02_pol;
address 172.64.244.68;
local-identity hostname b5ee5303<REDACTED>6555.ipsec.cloudflare.com;
external-interface ge-0/0/0.0;
version v2-only;
```

### Phase 2 - IPsec

#### IPsec proposal

Add an IPsec proposal that specifies the [Phase 2 Configuration Parameters](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters):

Add an IPsec proposal that specifies the [Phase 2 Configuration Parameters](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters):

```txt
set security ipsec proposal cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop protocol esp
set security ipsec proposal cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop authentication-algorithm hmac-sha-256-128
set security ipsec proposal cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ipsec proposal cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop lifetime-seconds 28800
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ipsec proposal cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop
```
```txt output
protocol esp;
authentication-algorithm hmac-sha-256-128;
encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc;
lifetime-seconds 28800;
```

#### IPsec Policy

Define one IPsec policy — reference the IPsec proposal created above.

```txt
set security ipsec policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol proposals cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ipsec policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol
```
```txt output
proposals cf_magic_wan_ipsec_prop;
```

#### IPsec VPN tunnels

Define two IPsec policies - one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels. It is crucial to ensure that:

- [Anti-replay](/magic-wan/reference/anti-replay-protection/) protection is disabled.
  - Use the [`no-anti-replay`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-adaptive-services/topics/ref/statement/no-anti-replay-edit-services.html) option.
- The SRX is the tunnel initiator:
  - Cloudflare will not instantiate the tunnel
  - If the SRX does not initiate the tunnel, then the tunnel will not be established until there is an attempt to connect to resources through the tunnel
  - Use [`establish-tunnels immediately`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-adaptive-services/topics/ref/statement/establish-tunnels-edit-services-ipsec-vpn.html) to ensure the SRX is the tunnel initiator.

**VPN Tunnel 1 (cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01)**

```txt
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01 bind-interface st0.0
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01 ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01 ike no-anti-replay
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01 ike ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01 establish-tunnels immediately
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_01
```
```txt output
bind-interface st0.0;
ike {
    gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_01;
    no-anti-replay;
    ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol;
}
establish-tunnels immediately;
```

**VPN Tunnel 2 (cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02)**

```txt
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02 bind-interface st0.1
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02 ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02 ike no-anti-replay
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02 ike ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02 establish-tunnels immediately
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_ipsec_tun_02
```
```txt output
bind-interface st0.1;
ike {
    gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_tun_02;
    no-anti-replay;
    ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol;
}
establish-tunnels immediately;
```

### Policy-Based Routing

The SRX platform provides policy-based routing functionality, which Juniper refers to as [filter-based forwarding](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/routing-policy/topics/concept/firewall-filter-option-filter-based-forwarding-overview.html).

Filter-based forwarding is implemented by configuring the following:

1. **Routing Instance**: Specify the routing table(s) to which a packet is forwarded and the destination to which the packet is forwarded at the [edit routing-instances] hierarchy level.
2. **Firewall Filter**: Use a stateless firewall filter to specify the source and destination addresses in conjunction with a routing instance that forwards traffic across the Magic IPsec tunnels, then bind the firewall filter to the ingress interface (trust zone).
3. **RIB Group**: Share interface routes with the forwarding routing instances used in filter-based forwarding (FBF).

:::note
Firewall filters must incorporate at least two terms:

- **Term 1**: Classify the traffic to forward to Magic WAN
- **Term 2**: Permit all other traffic — otherwise, the firewall filters will discard any traffic not intended for Magic WAN destinations.
:::

This configuration only factors in one local site (`10.1.20.0/24`). In this example, we assume devices in the trust zone must route traffic to a remote subnet at another Magic WAN-protected site (`10.1.100.0/24`).

Define a static route on the SRX to route traffic to `10.1.100.0/24` with redundant routes referencing each of the two tunnels.

**Routing Instance:**

[Routing Instances](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/routing-overview/topics/concept/routing-instances-overview.html) effectively add additional routing tables to the SRX platform.

As mentioned earlier, any traffic destined for other Magic WAN protected sites must be routed over the Magic IPsec tunnels.

The example includes two static routes - one to each of the two VTIs on the Cloudflare side of the  Magic IPsec Tunnels (`10.252.2.20` and `10.252.2.22`).

While it is possible to be more prescriptive in terms of the destination subnets, we simply use `0.0.0.0/0` as the firewall filter ensures only traffic destined for `10.1.100.0/24` will be forwarded to the routing instance. Any other traffic not destined for `10.1.100.0/24` will continue to the primary routing table (`inet.0`) as it falls outside the scope of the firewall filter configured in the next section below.

Leaving the destination subnet as `0.0.0.0/0` eases some administrative burden as you only need to modify the firewall filter to specify which traffic is destined for Magic WAN.

```txt
set routing-instances MAGIC_WAN_RI instance-type forwarding
set routing-instances MAGIC_WAN_RI routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.252.2.20
set routing-instances MAGIC_WAN_RI routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.252.2.22
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration routing-instances
```
```txt output
MAGIC_WAN_RI {
    instance-type forwarding;
    routing-options {
        static {
            route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop [ 10.252.2.20 10.252.2.22 ];
        }
    }
}
```

**Firewall Filter:**

In this step, we create a stateless firewall filter to ensure only packets from `10.1.20.0/24` destined for `10.1.100.0/24` are sent to the `MAGIC_WAN_RI` routing instance.

- **Term 1** - `MAGIC_WAN_NETS` ensures only packets from `10.1.20.0/24` destined for `10.1.100.0/24` are sent to the `MAGIC_WAN_RI` routing instance. Take note of the `count` statement defined in this term. [Count](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/routing-policy/topics/example/firewall-filter-stateless-example-act-on-sampling.html) allows you to view how many packets are processed by this term in the firewall filter. An example of how to view the Counter is included below.
- **Term 2** - `ALLOW_EVERYTHING_ELSE` ensures all other traffic continues to the primary routing table (`inet.0`).

```txt
set firewall family inet filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF term MAGIC_WAN_NETS from source-address 10.1.20.0/24
set firewall family inet filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF term MAGIC_WAN_NETS from destination-address 10.1.100.0/24
set firewall family inet filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF term MAGIC_WAN_NETS then count MAGIC_WAN_GATEWAY_FBF_count
set firewall family inet filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF term MAGIC_WAN_NETS then routing-instance MAGIC_WAN_RI
set firewall family inet filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF term ALLOW_EVERYTHING_ELSE then accept
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration firewall
```
```txt output
family inet {
    filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF {
        term MAGIC_WAN_NETS {
            from {
                source-address {
                    10.1.20.0/24;
                }
                destination-address {
                    10.1.100.0/24;
                }
            }
            then {
                count MAGIC_WAN_FBF_count;
                routing-instance MAGIC_WAN_RI;
            }
        }
        term ALLOW_EVERYTHING_ELSE {
            then accept;
        }
    }
}
```

**View Firewall Filter Counters**

To view the firewall filter counter:

```txt
admin@srx300> show firewall filter MAGIC_WAN_FBF counter MAGIC_WAN_FBF_count
```
```txt output
Filter: MAGIC_WAN_FBF

Counters:

Name                                      Bytes       Packets
MAGIC_WAN_FBF_count                       760174478   1940954
```

**Bind Firewall Filter to the interface in the** **trust** **zone:**

```txt
set interfaces ge-0/0/7 unit 0 family inet filter input MAGIC_WAN_FBF
set interfaces ge-0/0/7 unit 0 family inet address 10.1.20.1/24
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration interfaces ge-0/0/7 unit 0
```
```txt output
family inet {
    filter {
        input MAGIC_WAN_FBF;
    }
    address 10.1.20.1/24;
}
```

**RIB Group:**

RIB Groups allow you to concatenate the contents of multiple routing tables into a routing table group.

The primary routing table in the RIB group should be `inet.0` followed by the secondary routing table `MAGIC_WAN_RI.inet.0`  which is the `MAGIC_WAN_RI` routing-instance created above.

[Interface Routes](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/statement/interface-routes-edit-routing-options.html) referenced below by the `interface-routes` statement determines which interfaces and Routing Instances are bound to the RIB Group.

```txt
set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop <DEFAULT GATEWAY VIA ISP>
set routing-options rib-groups MAGIC_WAN_RG import-rib [ inet.0 MAGIC_WAN_RI.inet.0 ]
set routing-options interface-routes rib-group inet MAGIC_WAN_RG
set routing-options interface-routes rib-group inet MAGIC_WAN_RG
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration routing-options
```
```txt output
interface-routes {
    rib-group inet MAGIC_WAN_GW_RG;
}
static {
    route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop <DEFAULT GATEWAY VIA ISP>;
}
rib-groups {
    MAGIC_WAN_GW_RG {
        import-rib [ inet.0 MAGIC_WAN_RI.inet.0 ];
    }
}
```

### Security policies

Define security policies to permit traffic flows destined for Magic WAN-protected resources. The source/destination zones must incorporate the zone containing the tunnel interfaces.

There are two very simple rules to allow traffic bidirectionally — it is generally recommended to start with a similar policy and then add more stringent rules once general connectivity is established successfully.

**From Zone:** *Cloudflare* **To Zone:** *trust*

```txt
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match source-address any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match application any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust then permit
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust then log session-close
```

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust
```
```txt output
policy cloudflare_to_trust_permit {
    match {
        source-address any;
        destination-address any;
        application any;
    }
    then {
        permit;
        log {
            session-close;
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Validate tunnel connectivity

There are several diagnostic commands available to view the status of IPsec tunnels.

#### Ping across virtual tunnel interfaces

Use ping to test connectivity from the SRX side of the tunnel to the Cloudflare side of the tunnel. Ensure you use the source option to specify the IP address associated with tunnel interfaces `st0.0` and `st0.1`, respectively:

**Tunnel 1** - `st0.0 - 10.252.2.21`

```txt
admin@srx300> ping source 10.252.2.21 10.252.2.20
```
```txt output
PING 10.252.2.20 (10.252.2.20): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.252.2.20: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=8.429 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.20: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.134 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.20: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=4.028 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.20: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=3.855 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.20: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=3.811 ms
```

**Tunnel 2** - `st0.1 - 10.252.2.23`

```txt
admin@srx300> ping source 10.252.2.23 10.252.2.22
```
```txt output
PING 10.252.2.22 (10.252.2.22): 56 data bytes

64 bytes from 10.252.2.22: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=7.405 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.22: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=3.685 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.22: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=3.666 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.22: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=3.888 ms
64 bytes from 10.252.2.22: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=3.814 ms
```

#### Phase 1 - View Active Peers

[`show security ike active-peer`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/command/show-security-ike-active-peer.html)

172.XX.XXX.164            500      172.XX.XXX.164  not available     0.0.0.0
```

#### Phase 1 - View IKE Security Associations

[`show security ike security-associations`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/command/show-security-ike-security-associations.html)

```txt
admin@srx300> show security ike security-associations

### IKE `traceoptions`

It can be very helpful to enable debug logging via traceoptions while setting up the tunnels. The log data can help determine if there are issues and, if so, where they might be occurring.

Please note that some errors in the log are benign. The types of errors to look for are those related to authentication or encryption/integrity (that is, no proposal chosen).

#### Enable IKE `traceoptions`

[traceoptions (Security IKE)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/statement/security-edit-traceoptions-ike.html)

```txt
set security ike traceoptions file ike-debug.log
set security ike traceoptions file size 1m
set security ike traceoptions file files 3
set security ike traceoptions file world-readable
set security ike traceoptions flag all
```

The log file can be viewed by doing the following:

1. From an operational mode, run **start shell**.
2. Use the `tail` command to view the contents of the log file in real-time:

	```txt
	tail -f /var/log/ike-debug.log
	```

3. Press `CTRL + C` when finished.
4. Type `exit` to return to the operational mode prompt.

Either deactivate `traceoptions` or delete `traceoptions` once debugging is complete.

#### Deactivate IKE `traceoptions`

```txt
deactivate security ike traceoptions
```

Confirm `traceoptions` is deactivated with:

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ike traceoptions
```
```txt output
##
## inactive: security ike traceoptions
##
file ike-debug.log size 1m files 3 world-readable;
flag all;
```

### IPsec `traceoptions`

Refer to [traceoptions (Security IPsec)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/statement/security-edit-traceoptions-ipsec.html) for more information on this topic.

#### Enable IPsec `traceoptions`

```txt
set security ipsec traceoptions file ipsec-debug.log
set security ipsec traceoptions file size 1m
set security ipsec traceoptions file files 3
set security ipsec traceoptions file world-readable
set security ipsec traceoptions flag all
```

To view the log file:

1. From an operational mode, run `start shell`.
2. Use the tail command to view the contents of the log file in real time:
   `tail -f /var/log/ipsec-debug.log`
3. Press `CTRL + C` when finished.
4. Type `exit` to return to the operational mode prompt.

Either deactivate `traceoptions` or delete `traceoptions` once debugging is complete.

#### Delete IPsec `traceoptions`

```txt
delete security ipsec traceoptions
```

#### Deactivate IPsec `traceoptions`

```txt
deactivate security ipsec traceoptions
```

Confirm `traceoptions` is deactivated:

```txt
admin@srx300> show configuration security ipsec traceoptions
```
```txt output
##
## inactive: security ipsec traceoptions
##
file ipsec-debug.log size 1m files 3 world-readable;
flag all;
```
