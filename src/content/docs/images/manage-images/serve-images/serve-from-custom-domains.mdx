Image delivery is supported from all customer domains under the same Cloudflare account. To serve images through custom domains, an image URL should be adjusted to the following format:

```txt
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/<IMAGE_ID>/<VARIANT_NAME>
```

Example with a custom domain:

```txt
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA/083eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00/public
```

In this example, `<ACCOUNT_HASH>`, `<IMAGE_ID>` and `<VARIANT_NAME>` are the same, but the hostname and prefix path is different:

- `example.com`: Cloudflare proxied domain under the same account as the Cloudflare Images.
- `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery`: Path to trigger `cdn-cgi` image proxy.
- `ZWd9g1K7eljCn_KDTu_MWA`: The Images account hash. This can be found in the Cloudflare Images Dashboard.
- `083eb7b2-5392-4565-b69e-aff66acddd00`: The image ID.
- `public`: The variant name.

## Custom paths

By default, Images are served from the `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/` path. You can use Transform Rules to rewrite URLs and serve images from custom paths.

### Basic version

Free and Pro plans support string matching rules (including wildcard operations) that do not require regular expressions.

This example lets you rewrite a request from `example.com/images` to `example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>`.

To create a rule:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and website.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Overview**.
3. Next to **URL Rewrite Rules**, select **Create rule**.
4. Under **If incoming requests match**, select **Wildcard pattern** and enter the following **Request URL** (update with your own domain):

   ```txt
   https://example.com/images/*
   ```

5. Under **Then rewrite the path and/or query** > **Path**, enter the following values (using your account hash):

   - **Target path**: [`/`] `images/*`
   - **Rewrite to**: [`/`] `cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/${1}`

6. Select **Deploy** when you are done.

### Advanced version

:::note
This feature requires a Business or Enterprise plan to enable regular expressions in Transform Rules. Refer to Cloudflare [Transform Rules Availability](/rules/transform/#availability) for more information.
:::

This example lets you rewrite a request from `example.com/images/some-image-id/w100,h300` to `example.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/some-image-id/width=100,height=300` and assumes Flexible variants feature is turned on.

To create a rule:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and website.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Overview**.
3. Next to **URL Rewrite Rules**, select **Create rule**.
4. Under **If incoming requests match**, select **Custom filter expression** and then select **Edit expression**.
5. In the text field, enter `(http.request.uri.path matches "^/images/.*$")`.
6. Under **Path**, select **Rewrite to**.
7. Select _Dynamic_ and enter the following in the text field.

```txt
regex_replace(
  http.request.uri.path,
  "^/images/(.*)\\?w([0-9]+)&h([0-9]+)$",
  "/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/<ACCOUNT_HASH>/${1}/width=${2},height=${3}"
)
```

## Limitations

When using a custom domain, it is not possible to directly set up WAF rules that act on requests hitting the `/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/` path. If you need to set up WAF rules, you can use a Cloudflare Worker to access your images and a Route using your domain to execute the worker. For an example worker, refer to [Serve private images using signed URL tokens](/images/manage-images/serve-images/serve-private-images/).
