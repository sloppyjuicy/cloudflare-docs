## Alerts on policies

:::note
Applies to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.
:::

If you have configured [allow policies](/page-shield/policies/#policy-actions) in a zone (policies which allow specific scripts and connections and block everything else), you can filter alert notifications according to those policies.

When you set the **Policies of these zones** filter in a Page Shield alert, you will only receive the most relevant notifications based on the values of the allow policies you configured.

For each alert configured with a filter, Page Shield will do the following:

1. Check which allow policies in a zone are enabled.
2. For every enabled policy, compare the URL of the new or changed resource against the allowed sources in the policy.
3. If the resource is allowed by the policy, check if the new or modified resource should trigger the current Page Shield alert.
4. If the alert should trigger, send an alert notification to the configured destinations.

:::note
When you set the **Policies of these zones** filter in an alert you will not receive notifications for resources blocked by an allow policy. These are [policy violations](/page-shield/policies/violations/) that you can review in the dashboard, through GraphQL, or via Logpush.
:::

You will not receive notifications for alerts configured with a **Policies of these zones** filter in the following cases:

- No configured policies in the zone
- Policy configured in log mode
- Policy is not enabled

For alerts without a **Policies of these zones** filter, you will receive alerts for resources detected in all your zones, and you may receive alerts about resources that are blocked by one of your configured allow policies.
