To set up Email Security (formerly Area 1) for Gmail:

1. Log in to the [Email Security (formerly Area 1) dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Select the question mark, where you will be able to find your BCC address.
3. Once you found your address, select **Settings** (the gear icon), then select **New Domain**.
4. Fill in the information needed to add your domain:
  - **Domain**: Enter the domain you want to set up BCC from Google.
  - **Configured As**: Select Hops, enter `2`.
  - **Forwarding To**: Enter `google.com`.
  - **Outbound TLS**: Select **Forward all messages over TLS**.
  - **Quarantine policy**: Ensure no policy is selected.
5. Select **Publish Domain**.

## Next steps
