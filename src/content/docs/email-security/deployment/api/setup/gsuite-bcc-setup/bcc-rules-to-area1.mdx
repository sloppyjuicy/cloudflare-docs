1. In the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), go to **Menu** > **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail** > **Compliance**.
2. Go to **Content Compliance** > Select **Edit**.
3. Add a **Content Compliance** filter, and name it `Email Security (Area 1) - BCC`.
4. In **Email messages to affect**, select **Inbound**.
5. Select the recipients you want to send emails to Email Security (formerly Area 1) via BCC. Under **Add expressions that describe the content you want to search for in each message**:
    - Select **If ANY of the following match the message**.
    - Select **Add** to configure the expression.
      - Select **Advanced content match**.
      - In **Location**, select **Headers + Body**.
      - In **Match type**, select **Matches regex**.
      - In **Regexp** input `.*`. You can customize the regex as needed and test within the admin page or on sites like [Regexr](https://regexr.com/).
      - Select **SAVE**.
6. In **If the above expressions match, do the following**:
    - Select **Modify message**.
      - Ensure that **Envelope recipient** > **Change envelope recipient** is unselected, to ensure that emails will not be dropped as an unintended consequence. You will select this option at a later stage.
      - Go to **Also deliver to**, select **Add more recipients** > **ADD** > Choose **Advanced**.
        - Under **Envelope recipient**, select **Change envelope recipient** > **Replace recipient** > Enter the email of the recipient.
        - Under **Spam and delivery options**, select **Suppress bounces from this recipient**.
        - Under **Headers**, select **Add X-Gm-Spam and X-Gm-Phishy headers**.
        - Select **SAVE**.
7. In **Account types to affect**, select **Users** and **Groups**.
8. Select **SAVE**.

## Next steps

Now that you have added BCC rules on the Area 1 portal, you need to [create a project on Google Cloud Console](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/gsuite-bcc-setup/create-project-gcp/).
