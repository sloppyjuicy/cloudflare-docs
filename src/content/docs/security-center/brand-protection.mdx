## Domain search

To start searching for new domains that might be trying to impersonate your brand:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.

2. Go to **Security Center** > **Brand Protection**.

3. In **String query**, provide a name for your query. You can add multiple brand phrases on the same query, and the results will generate matches for all of those. Once you entered the string queries, select **Search matches**.

4. In the **Character distance**, select from `0-3`. The number of characters the results can differ from your domain.

   :::note

   If a brand phrase or search term has less than five characters, you can only choose a max distance of `0` (zero).
   :::

5. You can select **Save query** to monitor it in the future and perform other actions, such as delete, clone and set up alerts, according to your Paid plan limits.

6. To export all matches from a saved query, select your **Query name** > select the three dots > **Export matches**.

In the section **Monitor Strings**, you can check all the string queries that you selected to monitor. You can delete, clone, or create notifications for a string query. Refer to [Brand Protection Alerts](#brand-protection-alerts) to set up notifications.

## Logo queries

To set up a new logo query:

1. Go to **Security Center** > **Monitor Logos** and select **Add logo**.
2. Add a name for your query and upload your logo. Only the `.png`, `.jpeg`, and `.jpg` file extensions are supported.
3. Select **Save logo**.

The browser will return to the **Monitor Images** overview page, where you can access your query and configure notifications.

## Investigate a query

In this section, the dashboard displays:

- **Domain overview**.
- **WHOIS** that provides details about the date the domain was created, registrant and nameservers.
- **Domain history** that provides information on the domain category and when it was last changed. Refer to [Investigate threats](/security-center/investigate/investigate-threats/) for more details.
- **URL Reports** that provides information on any reported URL.

To investigate a string query:

1. Go to the **Monitor Strings** or **Monitor Logos** section to view all your queries.
2. Select a monitored query to inspect all the domains that matched your query.
3. Next to the domain, select **Domain** or **URL**. This will trigger a search on the [**Investigate**](/security-center/investigate/) section in a separate tab. URL scanner will also be triggered from **Brand Protection** through **Security Center** > **Investigate**. You will also have access to a report which will be generated automatically. The report will display screenshots of the matched domain, and the registrar of your domain.

## Brand Protection Alerts

   :::note

   You can also set up the alerts from your [Notifications](/notifications/) menu.

3. Create a notification name, add a description (optional), and select the monitored queries. You can also add a Webhook, and a notification email. You can add multiple email addresses.
