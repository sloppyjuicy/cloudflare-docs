After [enabling Security Insights](/security-center/get-started/) and letting the first scan run, check the **Security Insights** tab for a list of detected insights that you should address.

For each detected insight, you can resolve it or archive it, after understanding its risks.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to Account Home > **Security Center** > **Security Insights**.
3. Next to the insight you wish to address, select **Resolve**.

## Resolve an insight

In the insight details page, if you choose to update a configuration based on the recommendation actions, follow the instructions on the insight details page.

The following insights follow a different yet straightforward workflow to be resolved:

- **Minimum Version of TLS 1.2 not enforced**: To resolve this insight:
  - Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
  - Select **TLS 1.2**.
- **Domains without "Always use HTTPS"**: To resolve this insight:
  - Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
  - Select **Always Use HTTPS**.
- **Turn on JavaScript Detections**: To resolve this insight:
  - Go to **Security** > **Bots** > Select **Configure Bot Management**.
  - Select **JavaScript Detections**.

## Export insights

You can export security insights to a CSV format directly from the dashboard.

To export security insights:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.

Exporting security insights allow you to perform a deeper analysis of your insights. 

The exported CSV file includes information such as the severity of your data, insight type scan date, issue class and additional optional fields, such as insight details, risk assessment, detection method, and recommended actions.

## Enable alerts
