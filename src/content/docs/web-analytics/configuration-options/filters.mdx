To filter the data shown on Web Analytics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select the **Analytics & Logs** drop-down and choose **Web Analytics**.
3. Select the website you want to check.
4. Select **Add filter**.
5. In the **New filter** box, choose your criteria from the dropdown. Refer to the [Dimensions](/web-analytics/data-metrics/dimensions/) page for a list of available filters and their descriptions.
6. Select **Apply**.

### Additional tips

- By default, Web Analytics shows data for the previous 24 hours. Adjust the time range using the dropdown menu above the graph.
- Select and drag the cursor on the graph to choose a custom time period.
- Scroll below the graph to view detailed breakdowns, for instance of top visits by country or by device type.
