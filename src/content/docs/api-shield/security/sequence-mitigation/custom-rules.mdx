API Shield sequence custom rules use the configured API Shield <GlossaryTooltip term="session identifier">session identifier</GlossaryTooltip> to track the order of requests a user has made and the time between requests, and makes them available via [Cloudflare Rules](/rules). This allows you to write rules that match valid or invalid sequences.

These rules are different from [cookie sequence rules](/bots/concepts/sequence-rules/) in a few ways: 

- They only require an API Shield subscription.
- They require [session identifiers](/api-shield/get-started/#session-identifiers) to be set in API Shield.
- Because they use an API's session identifiers, they can be used for APIs designed for mobile applications.
- Because Cloudflare stores the user state in memory and not in a cookie, the session lifetime is limited to 10 minutes.

Rules built using these custom rules are different from sequence mitigation rules built [via API or the Cloudflare dashboard](/api-shield/security/sequence-mitigation/). The custom rules syntax enables free-form logic and response options that the dashboard does not.

## Example rules

Each saved endpoint will have an endpoint ID visible in its details page in Endpoint Management in the form of a UUID. The references below (`aaaaaaaa`, `bbbbbbbb`, and `cccccccc`) are the first eight characters of the endpoint ID.

The visitor must wait more than 2 seconds after requesting endpoint `aaaaaaaa` before requesting endpoint `bbbbbbbb`:

```txt
cf.sequence.current_op eq "bbbbbbbb" and 
cf.sequence.msec_since_op["aaaaaaaa"] ge 2000
```

The visitor must request endpoints `aaaaaaaa`, then `bbbbbbbb`, then `cccccccc` in that exact order:

```txt
cf.sequence.current_op eq "cccccccc" and 
cf.sequence.previous_ops[0] == "bbbbbbbb" and 
cf.sequence.previous_ops[1] == "aaaaaaaa"
```

The visitor must request endpoint `aaaaaaaa` before endpoint `bbbbbbbb`, but endpoint `aaaaaaaa` can be anywhere in the previous 10 requests:

```txt
cf.sequence.current_op eq "bbbbbbbb" and 
any(cf.sequence.previous_ops[*] == "aaaaaaaa")
```

The visitor must request either endpoint `aaaaaaaa` before endpoint `bbbbbbbb`, or endpoint `cccccccc` before endpoint `bbbbbbbb`:

```txt
(cf.sequence.current_op eq "bbbbbbbb" and 
any(cf.sequence.previous_ops[*] == "aaaaaaaa")) or 
(cf.sequence.current_op eq "bbbbbbbb" and 
any(cf.sequence.previous_ops[*] == "cccccccc"))
```
