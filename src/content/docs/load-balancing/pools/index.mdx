## Properties

For an up-to-date list of pool properties, refer to [Pool properties](/api/resources/load_balancers/subresources/pools/methods/list/) in our API documentation.

***

## Create pools

For step-by-step guidance, refer to [Create pools](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/).

***

## Per-endpoint Host header override

When your application needs specialized routing (`CNAME` setup or custom hosts like Heroku), change the `Host` header used in health monitor requests. For more details, refer to [Override HTTP Host headers](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/).
