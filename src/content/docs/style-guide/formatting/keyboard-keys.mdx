## Wording

- Use **select** instead of **click** when directing users to choose or select objects, commands, or options.
- Use **press** only when referring to pressing keys on a keyboard.

## Formatting keyboard shortcuts

When telling readers what keyboard shortcuts to use to achieve a result:
- Place the keyboard shortcut in between backticks (monospace formatting)
- Use uppercase letters with the abbreviated version of the key (`CTRL` instead of `CONTROL`, `CMD` instead of `COMMAND`for example)
- Wrap the complete keyboard shortcut in between backticks, including the plus sign:
	- **Do**:
	```mdx
	`CTRL + C`
	```

	- **Don't**:
	```mdx
	`CTRL` + `C`
	```
- Do not use the old `<kbd></kbd>` component
