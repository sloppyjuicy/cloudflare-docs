To invoke a [Lists API](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/list/) operation, append the endpoint to the Cloudflare API base URL:

`https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/`

For authentication instructions, refer to [Cloudflare's API: Getting Started](/fundamentals/api/get-started/).

For help with making API calls and paginating results, refer to [Make API calls](/fundamentals/api/how-to/make-api-calls/).

:::note


The Lists API endpoints require a value for `{account_id}`.

To retrieve a list of accounts to which you have access, use the [List Accounts](/api/resources/accounts/methods/list/) operation and note the IDs of the accounts you want to manage.


:::

The Lists API supports the operations outlined below. Visit the associated links for examples.



## Manage lists

| Operation | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Create a list](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/create/) | `POST accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists` | Creates an empty list |
| [Get lists](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/list/) | `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists` | Fetch all lists for the account. (This request does not fetch the items in the lists.) |
| [Get a list](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/get/) | `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}` | Fetches a list by its ID. (This request does not display the items in the list.) |
| [Update a list](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/update/) | `PUT accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}` | Updates the `description` of a list. You cannot edit the `name` or `kind`, and you cannot update items in a list. To update an item in a list, use the [Update all list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/update/) operation. |
| [Delete a list](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/delete/) | `DELETE accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}` | Deletes the list, but only when no filters reference it. |

## Manage items in a list



Nearly all the operations for managing items in a list are asynchronous. When you add or delete a large amount of items to or from a list, there may be a delay before the bulk operation is complete.

Asynchronous list operations return an `operation_id`, which you can use to monitor the status of an API operation. To monitor the status of an asynchronous operation, use the [Get bulk operation status](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/bulk_operations/methods/get/) endpoint and specify the ID of the operation you want to monitor.

When you make requests to a list while a bulk operation on that list is in progress, the requests are queued and processed in sequence (first in, first out). Requests for successful asynchronous operations return an `HTTP 201` status code.

### Get list items

- **Operation**: [Get list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/list/)
- **Method and endpoints**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items[?search={query}]`
- **Notes**: 
  - Fetches items in a list (all items, by default).
  - Items are sorted in ascending order.
  - In the case of IP lists, CIDRs are sorted by IP address, then by the subnet mask.
  - To filter returned items, use the optional `search` query string parameter. For more information, refer to the [Get list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/list/) API operation.

### Get a list item

- **Operation**: [Get a list item](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/get/)
- **Method and endpoints**: `GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items/{item_id}`
- **Notes**: Fetches an item from a list by ID
     
### Create list items

- **Operation**: [Create list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/create/)
- **Method and endpoints**: `POST accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
- **Notes**: 
  - Appends a new item or items to a list.
  - Replaces entries that already exist in the list, does not delete any items.
  - Overwrites the `comment` of the original item.
  - The response includes an `operation_id`.
   
### Update all list items

- **Operation**: [Update all list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/update/)
- **Method and endpoints**: `PUT accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
- **Notes**: 
  - Deletes all current items in the list and replaces them with `items`.
  - When `items` is empty, deletes **all** items in the list.
  - The response includes an `operation_id`.

### Delete list items

- **Operation**: [Delete list items](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/subresources/items/methods/delete/)
- **Method and endpoints**: `DELETE accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items`
- **Notes**: 
  - Deletes specified list items.
  - The response includes an `operation_id`.
