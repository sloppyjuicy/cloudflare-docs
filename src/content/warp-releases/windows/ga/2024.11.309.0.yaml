releaseNotes: |
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

  **Changes and improvements:**
  - Fixed an issue where SSH sessions and other application connections over TCP or UDP could drop when a device that is using MASQUE changes its primary network interface.
  - Fixed an issue to ensure the Cloudflare root certificate (or custom certificate) is installed in the trust store if not already there.
  - Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive during startup.
  - Extended diagnostics collection time in `warp-diag` to ensure logs are captured reliably.
  - Fixed an issue that was preventing proper operation of DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for consumer users.

  **Known issues:**
  - DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
    - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
    - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
    - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.

    To work around this issue, reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.
