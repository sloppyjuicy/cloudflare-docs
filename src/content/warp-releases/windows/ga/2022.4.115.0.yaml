releaseNotes: |-
  *PLEASE NOTE* If you are a Zero Trust customer and have strict firewall rules, you must visit https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#client-orchestration-api and explicitly allow our new Client Orchestration API Endpoints.
   
  This release contains new features and improvements from the last release
   
  **Notable updates**
   
  - Added support for Cloudflare Tunnels users to route traffic to distinct Virtual Networks with overlapping IP ranges
  - Added ability for users to manually refresh Zero Trust authentication via the Preferences->Account menu
  - Modified Client Orchestration API Endpoint the client connects to in Zero Trust mode
  - Modified warp-cli behavior of "connect" and "disconnect" to mimic "enable-always-on" and "disable-always-on" which themselves are copies of how the main toggle switch behaves in the UI
  - Modified client behavior to no longer do periodic tunnel connectivity checks. These checks frequently caused more problems than they solved.
  - Fixed issue where UI would not display correctly for users with multiple monitors or in VMWare [win]
  - Fixed connectivity issues over devices with embedded 4G [win]
  - Fix issue where Windows device could fail to renew IP address when coming out of sleep [win]
  - Fixed issue where Zero Trust users would receive a notification to update the client even though upgrades were disabled in settings
  - Fixed issue where the GUI would show disconnected when it should show Paused
  - Fixed various issues with warp-diag and improve overall stability
   
   
  **Known issues** 
  - UI incorrectly Shows Virtual Networks selector when there is only 1 default network. This UI should be hidden unless there are actually multiple networks to choose from.
