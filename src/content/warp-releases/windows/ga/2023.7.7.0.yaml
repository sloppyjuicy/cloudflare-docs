releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains new features, reliability improvements and bug fixes
  from both the previous beta and the previous GA build. We strongly encourage
  customers with domain based split tunneling rules to upgrade to this version.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added more status messages to the UI when the client is unable to connect

  - Added support for "SWG without DNS Filtering" mode. All DNS functionality
  from the WARP client is disabled while in this service mode 

  - Improved performance of the client when in the "Proxy Only" service mode

  - Improved performance of domain-based split tunneling when the IP was already
  split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)

  - Modified `warp-cli settings` to show if the applied settings came from local
  (mdm) or network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging profile
  issues easier

  - Fixed an issue that could result in increased latency when resolving queries

  - Fixed an issue where the GUI could indicate the incorrect service mode after
  entering an admin override code

  - Fixed an issue with re-authentication policies that could result in the
  browser loading a broken URL

  - Optimized the performance of DNS queries to prevent minor memory leaks

  - Fixed an issue when service token information was removed from an mdm.xml
  file the client would not prompt for user authentication as expected

  - Fixed an issue where localhost DNS proxy could not be set properly in
  certain VPN and VM configuration

  - Fixed localization issues in en-MX UI that caused longer strings to get
  truncated

  - Fixed an issue with certain tools like nslookup that was introduced in
  previous beta where DNS could appear broken

  - Fixed an issue where the WARP Client wouldn't properly detect if IPv6 was
  disabled via
  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters"

  - Fixed an issue where onboarding being set to False would not work if the GUI
  app started before the service 

  - Fixed an issue where the client would attempt to connect even when the "AUTO
  CONNECT" setting was Disabled in WARP Settings or not specified either in an
  MDM file

  - Fixed an issue where the client would not correctly detect and apply
  alternate network configuration between network changes
   
  **Known issues**

  - Customers may experience a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION Blue Screen when
  connecting. This error was introduced with the 2023.3 GA release and happens
  more frequently with larger split tunnel configurations, especially on more
  resource constrained machines. We are actively working on a fix. Until then we
  recommend staying on 2022.12 GA release OR reducing your split tunnel
  configuration if possible.

  - Managed network detection on certain Windows machines doesn't consistently
  apply the expected profile upon network changes. We will address this issue in
  a future release.
