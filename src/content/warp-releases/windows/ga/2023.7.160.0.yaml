releaseNotes: >-
  This is a critical hotfix for organizations that have long running deployment
  cycles. The certificate used to sign and validate our installer will expire on
  August 9th 2023 and may cause windows SmartScreen warnings on installation.
   
  This update is recommended for all customers and includes an important
  reliability fix.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Updated signing certificate

  - Fixed issue where client could take up to 1-2 minutes to recover
  connectivity instead of 1-2 seconds in the event of a service issue
   
  **Known issues**

  - Customers may experience a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION Blue Screen when
  connecting. This error was introduced with the 2023.3 GA release and happens
  more frequently with larger split tunnel configurations, especially on more
  resource constrained machines. We are actively working on a fix. Until then we
  recommend staying on 2022.12 GA release OR reducing your split tunnel
  configuration if possible.

  - Managed network detection on certain Windows machines doesn't consistently
  apply the expected profile upon network changes. We will address this issue in
  a future release.
