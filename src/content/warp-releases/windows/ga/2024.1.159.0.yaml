releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains a number of exciting new features and several
  improvements and bug fixes.


  **Notable updates**

  - Added the ability for the Client to display Gateway NETWORK and HTTP block
  notifications to the user.

  - Added the ability for administrators to specify multiple configurations in
  MDM files that users can toggle between. This allows users to more easily
  switch between production and test environments or for China users to switch
  between their override endpoints within the UI.

  - Added the ability for administrators to allow their end users to temporarily
  obtain access to local network resources in the event their home IP space
  overlaps with traffic normally routed through the WARP tunnel.

  - Improved existing re-auth notifications to be more visible and time
  sensitive.

  - Improved the handling of DNS server addresses to avoid conflicts with
  Windows OS setting of DHCP-sourced DNS server addresses.

  - Improved the retry mechanisms for DEX test results.

  - Improved the Device Posture Firewall check on Windows to ensure that all
  policy stores are checked.

  - Fixed an issue where DEX tests would run before the client was fully
  connected.


  **Known issues**

  - When `Install CA to system certificate store` is enabled, the certificate is
  not always properly left behind in
  `%ProgramData%\Cloudflare\installed_cert.pem`. This issue will be fixed in a
  future release.
