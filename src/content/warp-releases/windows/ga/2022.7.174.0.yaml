releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains a security fix for IPv6 users introduced in a prior
  release, major bug fixes and a significant change to the Zero Trust
  authentication flow.


  **NOTE** This release contains a bug that impacts Zero Trust users who deploy
  with .msi command line parameters that will break clean installs. For clean
  installs please move forward to 2022.7.421
   
  **Notable updates**
   
  - Added C:\ProgramData\Cloudflare\cfwarp_daemon_dns.txt log file when DNS
  logging is enabled

  - Added `do not fragment` bit to WARP tunnel traffic

  - Added ability for posture rules that support file paths to use environment
  variables as part of the path

  - Modified Zero Trust authentication flow to no longer rely on WebView2
  embedded experience and use default browser instead

  - Modified output of `warp-cli account` and `warp-cli settings` to make
  parsing information easier

  - Modified client UI during re-authentication flow to always appear as the top
  most window so it is less likely users will miss it

  - Fixed major issue introduced with 2022.5.341 where IPv6 traffic was no
  longer consistently routed through the tunnel

  - Fixed issue where warp-svc.exe may not start due to missing VCRUNTIME140.dll
  on some systems

  - Fixed issue that could result in broken DNS for users running WiFi until an
  admin manually reset DNS back to default

  - Fixed issue where the UI could appear stretched when using an external
  monitor

  - Fixed issue where warp-cli could be used determine a valid admin override
  code

  - Fixed issue where warp-cli could be used to enable/disable on wifi networks
  when in Zero Trust mode

  - Fixed issue where the UI could get a barrage of notifications when coming
  out of modern standby

  - Fixed issue where you would receive a notification immediately after install
  that your internet was no longer private

  - Fixed issue with domain based split tunnels when a wildcard is used.
  Anything after the `*` was included in the wildcard search so `*.example.com`
  would include  `badexample.com`

  - Fixed issue where client was sending improper ICMP responses when MTU needed
  to change

  - Fixed UI issue when going between light/dark modes

  - Fixed issue where logs could grow too large
   
  **Known issues**

  - This version requires at least Windows 10.0.19042. If you are running a
  prior version of Windows, please delay upgrading.

  - Zero Trust users who perform a clean install of the client utilizing msi
  parameters will result in the GUI being in a broken state and not asking for
  authentication. This is fixed in 2022.7.421
