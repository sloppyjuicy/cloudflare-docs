releaseNotes: >-

  **Notable updates**

  - Fixed issue where WARP DNS servers stay set after Windows update, causing no
  network for user

  client UI

  - Fixed bug that could cause Teams registration to fail (mostly server side
  but mentioning here as well) and handoff from the success page in the browser
  to the client

  registration fails instead of hundreds

  - Fixed DNS fallback timeouts and related performance issues

  unreasonably long time to connect

  its connection

  - Fixed issue where user experienced no network after boot
