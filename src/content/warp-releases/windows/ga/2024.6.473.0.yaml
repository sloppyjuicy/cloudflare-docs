releaseNotes: >-
  This release only contains a hotfix from the 2024.6.415.0 release.
     
  **Notable updates**

  - Fixed an issue which could cause alternate network detections to fail for
  hosts using TLS 1.2 which do not support TLS Extended Master Secret (EMS).

  - Improved the stability of device profile switching based on alternate
  network detection.
      
  **Known issues**

  - If a user has an MDM file configured to support multiple profiles (for the
  switch configurations feature), and then changes to an MDM file configured for
  a single profile, the WARP client may not connect. The workaround is to use
  the `warp-cli registration delete` command to clear the registration, and then
  re-register the client.

  - There are certain known limitations preventing the use of the MASQUE tunnel
  protocol in certain scenarios. Do not use the MASQUE tunnel protocol if:
    - A Magic WAN integration is on the account and is not yet migrated to the warp_unified_flow. Please check migration status with your account team.
    - Your account has Regional Services enabled.
