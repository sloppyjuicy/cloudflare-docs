releaseNotes: >-
  **Major change**

  WARP On Windows now uses a new tunnel architecture that more closely matches
  our macOS and Linux implementations. WARP will now create a virtual interface
  that is visible in your network connections and directly modify the routing
  table to control where traffic flows. Please thoroughly test this release
  before deploying in your organization.
    
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)

  - Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring

  - Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users
  local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through
  the tunnel

  - Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client
  install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled.

  - Improve timeouts with broken CNAME records that could result in very long
  load times for certain apps (Office 365 apps, etc.)

  - Improved compatibility with apps like Firefox and Zoom that use custom MTU
  settings

  - Improved UI states for WARP client

  - Improved user validation logic during manual ZT login

  - Improved logging of application posture checks to understand rationale
  behind statuses of application checks (file missing, process not found, etc.)

  - Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the
  tunnel as per original intent

  - Fixed issue where systems with significantly out of sync system clocks could
  fail registration

  - Fixed a number of GUI crash bugs that would cause the app to disappear from
  the system tray

  - Fixed issue that could cause the application to be hidden behind the Windows
  system tray expanded list UI

  - Fixed issue where warp-diag could run traceroutes longer than expected.
  Traceroute tests will now timeout after 65 seconds.

  - Fixed issue where the WARP service can crash and lose connectivity

  - Fixed issue where manually logging into a ZT org could fail if certificate
  authentication was used

  - Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service
  resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI
  could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`

  - Fix issue where IPv6 being disabled via the registered wasn't properly
  detected

  - Fixed issue when running in local proxy mode where too many log entries were
  written
   
  **Known issues**

  - Customers who have modified the default split tunnel configuration or use
  managed networks may find some of the routes that should go through the tunnel
  are unreachable. This is now fixed in a hotfix release.
