releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and user experience change for customers using
  Zero Trust `Enforce WARP session duration` Gateway policies
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Modified client behavior to no longer automatically open a new browser tab
  when user needs to reauthenticate as this was causing some users to return to
  their devices with 100s of tabs open. Instead the client will now use the
  built in operating system notification framework to inform users of the need
  to authenticate.

  - Fixed issue where deployments with .msi command line parameters would result
  in a broken client state 

  - Fixed issues with device registration after logging out/in of the client.

  - Fixed issue where file device posture checks wouldn't work correctly when
  the file path was changed for an existing rule.
   
  **Known issues**

  - This version requires at least Windows 10.0.19042. If you are running a
  prior version of Windows, please delay upgrading. This will be fixed in the
  next release.

  - Some Zero Trust customers with Chromium browsers with certain browser
  management profiles may experience issues completing initial device
  registration. This will be fixed in the next release.
