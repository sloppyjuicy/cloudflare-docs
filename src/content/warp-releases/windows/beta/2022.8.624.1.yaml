releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains bug fixes from the previous beta (2022.8.558.1). Please
  note that the issue preventing the client from working with Windows versions
  older than 10.0.19042 is now fixed in this release. We also wanted to call out
  that we've made server side changes to significantly reduce captcha issues for
  users with IPv6 enabled (no client related change but wanted to call out the
  work).

  **Notable updates**
   
  - Fixed crash of daemon after wake from sleeping which could cause loss of
    network connectivity or the GUI to freeze 
  - Fixed issue with includeonly tunnels reconnecting every ~135 seconds
   
  **Known issues**
  - No known issues
