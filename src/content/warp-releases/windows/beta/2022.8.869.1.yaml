releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains bug fixes from the previous beta (2022.8.624.1). Please
  note that the issue preventing the client from working with Windows versions
  older than 10.0.19042 is now fixed in this release. We also wanted to call out
  that we've made server side changes to significantly reduce captcha issues for
  users with IPv6 enabled (no client related change but wanted to call out the
  work).

  **Notable updates**
   
  - Added ability for ZT Administrators to specify if they want embedded WebView2 browser to be used instead of the default system browser. See [Deployment documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/#install-warp-on-windows) for more information
  - Fixed failure to reconnect to WARP due to DNS stub server AddrInUse failures
