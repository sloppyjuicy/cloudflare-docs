releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and a major new architecture for how traffic
  is handled on Windows from the previous beta release. Please read entire
  release notes.
   
  *Major change*

  WARP On Windows will now use a new tunnel architecture that more closely
  matches our macOS and Linux implementations. WARP will now create a virtual
  interface that is visible in your network connections and directly modify the
  routing table to control where traffic flows. Please thoroughly test this
  release before deploying in your organization. 
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2).

  - Improved compatibility with apps like Firefox and Zoom that use custom MTU
  settings.

  - Fixed issue where warp-diag could run traceroutes longer than expected.
  Traceroute tests will now timeout after 65 seconds.

  - Improved UI states for WARP client.

  - Improved user validation logic during manual ZT login.

  - Fixed issue where the WARP service can crash and lose connectivity.

  - Fixed issue where manually logging into a ZT org could fail if certificate
  authentication was used.
   

   
  **Known issues**

  - If you encounter issues during upgrade/install, please restart your Windows
  device (this issue will be resolved in a future release).
