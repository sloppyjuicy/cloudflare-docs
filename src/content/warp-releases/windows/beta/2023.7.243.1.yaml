  **Notable updates**

  - Fixed issue where DoH requests could take too long to timeout causes DNS
  reliability issues
   

   
  **Known issues**

  - Customers may experience a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION Blue Screen when
  connecting. This error was introduced with the 2023.3 GA release and happens
  more frequently with larger split tunnel configurations, especially on more
  resource constrained machines. We are actively working on a fix. Until then we
  recommend staying on 2022.12 GA release OR reducing your split tunnel
  configuration if possible.
