releaseNotes: >-
  In addition to general bug fixes this release contains two new exciting
  features.


  The first we hope will improve diagnosing connectivity issues by bubbling up
  common errors to the GUI so admins no longer have to dig through logs to find
  a conflicting app or configuration issue.


  The second is a new Zero Trust posture support: checking for the presence of a
  certificate. You can get started today from your dashboard.


  **Notable updates**

  - Added connectivity error reasons to the UI

  - Added new posture type: Check for presence of a certificate

  - Fixed an issue with DEX traceroutes tests where not all hops were correctly
  reported

  - Fixed an issue where the WARP background process could crash under extreme
  load

  - Fixed an issue where the Windows GUI could spam the Windows System Eventlog
  with unhelpful error messages

  - Fixed an issue where managed network detection could fail when firewall
  rules were not correctly removed under certain disconnect scenarios

  - Fixed a timing issue exposed during previous beta where the client could get
  stuck on Connecting state. This mostly happens coming out of sleep or
  switching teams 
   
  **Known issues**

  - Customers may experience a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION Blue Screen when
  connecting. This error was introduced with the 2023.3 GA release and happens
  more frequently with larger split tunnel configurations, especially on more
  resource constrained machines. We are actively working on a fix. Until then we
  recommend staying on 2022.12 GA release OR reducing your split tunnel
  configuration if possible.
