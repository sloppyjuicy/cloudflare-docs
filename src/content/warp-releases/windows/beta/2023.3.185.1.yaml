releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains only bug fixes from the previous beta release. 


  As stated in the previous beta notes, we are now feature complete for the
  quarter and will begin focusing exclusively on QA and bug fixes only. We
  encourage customers to test with this version and report issues ASAP.
   
  *Major change*

  As a reminder, starting with the previous beta 2023.1.625.1, WARP On Windows
  now uses a new tunnel architecture that more closely matches our macOS and
  Linux implementations. WARP will now create a virtual interface that is
  visible in your network connections and directly modify the routing table to
  control where traffic flows. Please thoroughly test this release before
  deploying in your organization. 
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Fixed issue introduced in previous beta when there is both an Ethernet and a
  Wifi interface present and active the machine

  - Improved logging of application posture checks to understand rationale
  behind statuses of application checks (file missing, process not found, etc.)
   
  **Known issues**

  - Latest Windows client may take a few seconds to change to update the
  connection status after initial registration.
