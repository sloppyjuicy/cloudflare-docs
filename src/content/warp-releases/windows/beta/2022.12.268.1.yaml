releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and a new UI `Connectivity` panel in
  preferences (Windows only at the moment) to assist with debugging. Please give
  it a try and let us know how it works!
   
  **Notable updates**

  - New `Connectivity` tab in the GUI bubbles up helpful information (Windows
  only for now). Please let us know how this works for you.

  - Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.

  - Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a
  full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).

  - Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and
  IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either
  connects successfully.

  - Fixed issue where UI could appear hung.

  - Fixed issue where progress bar won't appear during update until update is
  completed.

  - Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS
  checks failed once.

  - Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at
  the end of a CNAME chain.

  - Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings,
  re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.

  - Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if
  you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their
  client to your organization.

  - Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an
  NXDOMAIN record is returned.

  - Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it
  wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.

  - Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly
  active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.

  - Fixed issue where if `support_url` doesn't have a protocol definitely we now
  automatically add `https`

  - Fixed issue where the Cloudflare WARP system Service may crash if a long
  running child process crashes (such as ipconfig, netsh, etc.)
