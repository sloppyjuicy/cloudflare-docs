releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and new features from the previous beta
  release. With this release we are now feature complete for the quarter and
  will begin focusing exclusively on QA and bug fixes only. We encourage
  customers to test with this version and report issues ASAP.
   
  *Major change*

  As a reminder, starting with the previous beta 2023.1.625.1, WARP On Windows
  now uses a new tunnel architecture that more closely matches our macOS and
  Linux implementations. WARP will now create a virtual interface that is
  visible in your network connections and directly modify the routing table to
  control where traffic flows. Please thoroughly test this release before
  deploying in your organization. 
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring. More information
  coming soon for customers who signed up for the beta

  - Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users
  local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through
  the tunnel

  - Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client
  install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled. A new
  toggle switch will appear in the dashboard under Settings->WARP Client soon to
  enable this

  - Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the
  tunnel as per original intent

  - Fixed issue introduced in previous beta, and called out in known issues,
  where users may need to restart or perform a clean install after upgrade to
  the new release

  - Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service
  resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI
  could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`
   
  **Known issues**

  - Latest Windows client may take a few seconds to change to update the
  connection status after initial registration.

  - If you encounter issues during upgrade/install, please restart your Windows
  device (this issue will be resolved in a future release).
