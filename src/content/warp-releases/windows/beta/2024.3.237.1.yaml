releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains no new features and is focused exclusively on
  improvements.


  **Notable updates**

  - Windows client downloads will now contain version numbers in the file name
  to allow easy identification.

  - Enabled re-authentication and other notifications to always be shown
  (without sound) regardless of Windows Focus Assist settings.

  - Suppressed the GUI certificate error message "Limited connectivity: A
  certificate missing; please contact your administrator" for a scenario where
  it was not needed.

  - Improved the re-connection logic to minimize impact to existing tunneled TCP
  sessions.

  - Corrected an issue where the DNS server information was being improperly
  persisted across network changes.

  - Increased the data collected by warp-diag to improve debugging capabilities.


  **Known issues**

  - When `Install CA to system certificate store` is enabled, the certificate is
  not always properly left behind in
  `%ProgramData%\Cloudflare\installed_cert.pem`. This issue will be fixed in a
  future release.
