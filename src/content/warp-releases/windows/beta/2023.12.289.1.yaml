releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains exciting new features and bug fixes for both DEX and
  notifications. Please take time over the next few weeks to play with the new
  functionality and let us know what you think on both the community forum and
  through your account teams.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added ability for Client to display Gateway NETWORK and HTTP block
  notifications to the user (feature to be available in dash in the coming
  week).

  - Added ability for administrators to specify multiple configurations in MDM
  files that users can toggle between. This allows users to more easily switch
  between production and test environments or China customers to switch between
  their override endpoints within the UI.

  - Improved existing re-auth notifications to be more visible and time
  sensitive.

  - Fixed an issue where DEX tests would run before the client was fully
  connected.
   
  **Known issues**

  - The new `display_name` MDM parameter that is part of the multiple
  configurations feature is not correctly working. For this release the name
  visible in the UI will be the organization value. A future beta release will
  correct this; it is safe to include this parameter in updated MDM files now.
