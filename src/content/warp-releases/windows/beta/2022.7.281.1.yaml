releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains couple of fixes from last GA build. No other bug fixes
  or feature are included.
   
  **Notable updates**
   
  - Modified client behavior to no longer automatically open a new browser tab
  when user needs to re-authenticate as this was causing some users to return to
  their devices with 100s of tabs open. Instead the client will now use the
  built in operating system notification framework to inform users of the need
  to authenticate.


  - Fixed an issue with enrolling Zero Trust users using Windows installer.
   
  **Known issues**

  - This version requires at least Windows 10.0.19042. If you are running a
  prior version of Windows, please delay upgrading
