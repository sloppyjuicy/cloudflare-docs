releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains new features and improvements from the last release. In
  particular, we have made significant changes to how local settings (MDM) are
  processed and how they work with new devices settings in the dashboard.


  **Notable updates** 

  - Added support for Gateway session duration enforcement allowing you to force
  re-authentication after a specified time.

  - Fixed issue where context menu would remain after you quit the GUI.

  - Fixed wake from sleep issue where DNS requests could fail.

  - Improved overall stability of Windows installer.


  **Known issues** 

  - If you change organizations by pushing a new mdm.xml file while the user is
  already logged in to an organization the client will get in to a bad state and
  need to be uninstalled.

  - Any change to the mdm.xml file will require the user to re-authenticate when
  they shouldn't have to.
