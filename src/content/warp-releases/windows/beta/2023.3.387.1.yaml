  **Major change**

  WARP On Windows now uses a new tunnel architecture that more closely matches
  our macOS and Linux implementations. WARP will now create a virtual interface
  that is visible in your network connections and directly modify the routing
  table to control where traffic flows. Please thoroughly test this release
  before deploying in your organization.
    
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)

  - Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring

  - Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users
  local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through
  the tunnel

  - Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client
  install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled.

  - Improve timeouts with broken CNAME records that could result in very long
  load times for certain apps (Office 365 apps, etc.)

  - Improved compatibility with apps like Firefox and Zoom that use custom MTU
  settings

  - Improved UI states for WARP client

  - Improved user validation logic during manual ZT login

  - Improved logging of application posture checks to understand rationale
  behind statuses of application checks (file missing, process not found, etc.)

  - Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the
  tunnel as per original intent

  - Fixed issue where systems with significantly out of sync system clocks could
  fail registration

  - Fixed a number of GUI crash bugs that would cause the app to disappear from
  the system tray

  - Fixed issue that could cause the application to be hidden behind the Windows
  system tray expanded list UI

  - Fixed issue where warp-diag could run traceroutes longer than expected.
  Traceroute tests will now timeout after 65 seconds.

  - Fixed issue where the WARP service can crash and lose connectivity

  - Fixed issue where manually logging into a ZT org could fail if certificate
  authentication was used

  - Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service
  resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI
  could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`

  - Fix issue where IPv6 being disabled via the registered wasn't properly
  detected

  - Fixed issue when running in local proxy mode where too many log entries were
  written
