releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and support for a new operating mode called
  "Secure Web Gateway without DNS Filtering". This new mode disabled all DNS
  functionality of the client while still retaining things such as the WARP
  Tunnel, DEX and posture support.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Add support for "SWG without DNS Filtering" mode

  - Add support for ProductVersionExtra to be used in OS Version posture checks

  - Improve performance of domain-based split tunneling when the IP was already
  split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)

  - Fixed issue that could cause many requests for authentication to open in the
  browser

  - Fixed issue where client could get into a bad state when auth id/secret
  removed from plist
   
  **Known issues**

  - If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall
  current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in
  beta program from Preferences -> Advanced.
