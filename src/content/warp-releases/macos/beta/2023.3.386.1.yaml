releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains new features and improvements from last GA release.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring. More information
  coming soon for customers who signed up for the beta

  - Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users
  local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through
  the tunnel

  - Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client
  install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled. A new
  toggle switch will appear in the dashboard under Settings->WARP Client soon to
  enable this

  - Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the
  tunnel as per original intent

  - Modified firewall behavior to allow incoming UDP traffic on ports 67-68 over
  split tunnel routes configured to be protected by Gateway. This change should
  allow organizations with overlapping networks to an end users local network,
  to not leave their users in a completely broken state without internet
  connectivity

  - Improved user validation logic during manual ZT login

  - Improve timeouts with broken CNAME records that could result in very long
  load times for certain apps (Office 365 apps, etc.)

  - Fixed issue where trying to launch a support_url without a valid protocol
  handler (ex. https://) would result in an error

  - Fixed issue where systems with significantly out of sync system clocks could
  fail registration

  - Fixed panic that could result in loss of internet connectivity

  - Fixed issue where the WARP daemon can crash and lose connectivity

  - Fixed issue where warp-diag could run traceroutes longer than expected.
  Traceroute tests will now timeout after 65 seconds.

  - Fixed issue where manually logging into a ZT org could fail if certificate
  authentication was used

  - Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service
  resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI
  could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`

  - Fixed issue when running in local proxy mode where too many log entries were
  written
