releaseNotes: >-
  In addition to general bug fixes this release contains two new exciting
  features.


  The first we hope will improve diagnosing connectivity issues by bubbling up
  common errors to the GUI so admins no longer have to dig through logs to find
  a conflicting app or configuration issue.


  The second is a new Zero Trust posture support: checking for the presence of a
  certificate. You can get started today from your dashboard. 
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added connectivity error reasons to the UI

  - Added new posture type: Check for presence of a certificate

  - Modify IPv6 DNS behavior to no longer bind to discrete stub resolvers and
  instead point interfaces at a V6->V4 mapping `::ffff:127.0.2.2`. This change
  makes DNS mapping consistent on all platforms

  - Fixed an issue with DEX traceroutes tests where not all hops were correctly
  reported

  - Fixed am issue where the WARP background process could crash under extreme
  load

  - Fixed an issue where managed network detection could fail when firewall
  rules were not correctly removed under certain disconnect scenarios

  - Fixed a timing issue exposed during previous beta where the client could get
  stuck on Connecting state. This mostly happens coming out of sleep or
  switching teams

  - Fixed an issue where an invalid override code could cause warp to disconnect
  when the lock switch was not set to true
   
  **Known issues**

  - No known issues
