  **Notable updates**

  - Improved DNS logging to track down an issue where DNS isn't properly applied
  coming out of sleep

  - Tweaked DNS behavior to work better with some captive portals (United in
  particular)

  - Fixed an issue with Managed Networks where if the managed endpoint
  overlapped with your exclude split tunnel configuration, the split tunnel
  would only be open for IP traffic destined to the same port as your managed
  TLS endpoint

  - Fixed an issue where IPv6 traffic could be incorrectly sent down the tunnel
  in exclude mode

  - Fixed an issue introduced in previous beta where the client could be stuck
  on connecting forever
