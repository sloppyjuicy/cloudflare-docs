releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains exciting new features. Please take time over the next
  few weeks to play with the new functionality and let us know what you think on
  both the community forum and through your account teams.


  **Notable updates**

  - Added the ability for administrators to allow their end users to temporarily
  obtain access to local network resources in the event their home IP space
  overlaps with traffic normally routed through the WARP tunnel.

  - The last beta added the ability for the client to display Gateway Network
  and HTTP block notifications to the user. We later added the ability to
  configure this feature in the dash; the end-to-end solution is now available.

  - Fixed an issue introduced in the previous beta where the organization name
  was case-sensitive (it should not be)

  - Fixed a crash (segfault) when running warp-diag on some systems


  **Known issues**

  - The new `display_name` MDM parameter that is part of the multiple
  configurations feature is not correctly working. For this release, the name
  visible in the UI will be the organization value. A future beta release will
  correct this; it is safe to include this parameter in updated MDM files now
