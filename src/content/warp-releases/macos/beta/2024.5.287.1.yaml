releaseNotes: |
  This is a release focused on fixes and improvements.

  **Notable updates:**
  - Fixed a known issue where the certificate was not always properly left behind in `/Library/Application Support/Cloudflare/installed_cert.pem`.
  - Fixed an issue so that that the reauth notification is cleared from the UI when the user switches configurations.
  - Fixed an issue by correcting the WARP client setting of macOS firewall rules. This relates to TunnelVision (CVE-2024-3661).
  - Fixed an issue that could cause the Cloudflare WARP menu bar application to disappear when switching configurations.

  **Known issues:**
  - If a user has an MDM file configured to support multiple profiles (for the switch configurations feature), and then changes to an MDM file configured for a single profile, the WARP client may not connect. The workaround is to use the 'warp-cli registration delete' command to clear the registration, and then re-register the client.
