releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains a single change to the behavior of the client when WARP
  session duration Gateway Network or HTTP policies are in place. No other bug
  fixes or feature are included.
   
  **Notable updates**
   
  - Modified client behavior to no longer automatically open a new browser tab
  when user needs to re-authenticate as this was causing some users to return to
  their devices with 100s of tabs open. Instead the client will now use the
  built in operating system notification framework to inform users of the need
  to authenticate.
   
  **Known issues**

  - No known issues
