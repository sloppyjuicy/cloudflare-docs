releaseNotes: >-
  This release primarily contains bug fixes, no new features are included in
  this release
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.

  - Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a
  full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).

  - Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and
  IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either
  connects successfully. 

  - Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS
  checks failed once.

  - Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at
  the end of a CNAME chain.

  - Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings,
  re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.

  - Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if
  you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their
  client to your organization.

  - Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an
  NXDOMAIN record is returned.

  - Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it
  wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.

  - Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly
  active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.
   
  **Known issues**

  - There is a race condition that may cause IPv4 traffic to fail after the
  tunnel starts up. This can be fixed by togglingÂ off then back on the
  connection. A hotfix is in the works.

  - If you are having issues with upgrading to new beta, please uninstall
  current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in
  beta program from Preferences->Advanced.
