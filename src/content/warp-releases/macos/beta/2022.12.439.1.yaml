  release
   
  **Notable updates**

  info to be released soon on how you can test.

  - Fixed issue where `warp-cli teams-enroll` wouldn't work when an mdm file was
  present

  - Fixed issue where our localhost dns endpoints (ex. 127.0.2.2) could appear
  in the fallback configuration potentially causing DNS lookups to fail

  - Fixed issues where GUI could crash when opening from the Menu Bar

  - Fixed issue that could cause some DNS queries to take upto 15 seconds to
  complete
   

   
  **Known issues**

  - There is a race condition that may cause IPv4 traffic to fail after the
  tunnel starts up. This can be fixed by togglingÂ off then back on the
  connection. A hotfix is in the works.

  current app, install the GA version from https://1.1.1.1/ and participate in
