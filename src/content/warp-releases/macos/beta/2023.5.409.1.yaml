  This release contains reliability improvements and general bug fixes. No new
  features are introduced with this release.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Improved performance of client when in Proxy Only mode

  - Modified `warp-cli settings` to now show if setting came from local (mdm) or
  network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging issues easier

  - Fixed issue that could result in latency increases every few minutes

  - Fixed a consumer only issue where a license key of excessive length could
  result in 100% cpu usage

  - Fixed a minor memory leak every time we did a DNS query

  - Fixed issue when service token information was removed from .plist the
  client would not prompt for user authentication as expected

  - Fixed 3rd party VPN Compatibility by adding a default /32 subnet to
  interfaces that don't have them by default (this was specifically to fix
  compat with NordLayer but may help others)

  - Fixed issue where re-authentication button could show up in consumer 1.1.1.1
  mode even though it is just a Zero Trust feature
