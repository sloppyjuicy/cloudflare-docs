releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and new features from the previous Beta
  release. With this release we are now feature complete for the quarter and
  will begin focusing exclusively on QA and bug fixes only. We encourage
  customers to test with this version and report issues ASAP.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for Zero Trust Digital Experience Monitoring. More information
  coming soon for customers who signed up for the beta

  - Added new log message to help customers and support identify when a users
  local network IP space overlaps with a remote network configured to go through
  the tunnel

  - Added support for Zero Trust customers to opt in to having the WARP Client
  install the root CA for your organization if TLS Decryption is enabled. A new
  toggle switch will appear in the dashboard under Settings->WARP Client soon to
  enable this

  - Modified behavior of Managed networks tests to always happen outside the
  tunnel as per original intent

  - Modified firewall behavior to allow incoming UDP traffic on ports 67-68 over
  split tunnel routes configured to be protected by Gateway. This change should
  allow organizations with overlapping networks to an end users local network,
  to not leave their users in a completely broken state without internet
  connectivity

  - Fixed issue introduced in previous beta with delays in initial registration
  and onboarding flows

  - Fixed issue introduced in previous beta where entering the admin override
  code would not turn off the toggle switch for the user

  - Fixed issue where GUI could miss a status message from the WARP Service
  resulting in the wrong state being reflected to users. An example is the GUI
  could show `Connecting` even though device was `Connected`
