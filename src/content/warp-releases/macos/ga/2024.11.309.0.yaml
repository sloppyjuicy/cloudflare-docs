releaseNotes: |
  This release contains reliability improvements and general bug fixes.

  **Changes and improvements:**
  - Fixed an issue where SSH sessions and other application connections over TCP or UDP could drop when a device that is using MASQUE changes its primary network interface.
  - Fixed an issue to ensure the Cloudflare root certificate (or custom certificate) is installed in the trust store if not already there.
  - Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive during startup.
  - Extended `warp-diag` to collect system profiler firewall state as part of diagnostics.
  - Fixed an issue with the WARP client becoming unresponsive while handling LAN inclusion.
  - Fixed an issue where users were unable to connect with an IPC error message displayed in the UI.
  - Fixed an issue that was preventing proper operation of DNS-over-TLS (DoT) for consumer users.

  **Known issues:**
  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare  recommends the use of macOS 15.1 or later.
