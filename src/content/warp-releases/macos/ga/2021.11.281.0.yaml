releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains new features and improvements from the last release.


  - Starting with this release our version number scheme has now changed to
  YYYY.M.build_number (ex. 2021.11.123).

  - Use timestamps in log file names stored by warp-diag.

  - Added traceroute information to warp-diag for Teams destinations to help
  debug connectivity issues.

  - warp-diag now reports status when run from terminal so you can see it
  working.

  - warp-diag now allows for --output flag so you can specify where diagnostics
  data is stored.

  - Improved general reliability issues by moving DoH requests outside the
  tunnel

  - Improved overall reliability of daemon/service including how it connects to
  the GUI (reduce instance of IPC errors).

  - Fixed localhost proxy mode which was broken in last release.

  - Fixed issue where posture checks were not running every 5 minutes like they
  should.

  - Fixed issue where DNS sockets could sometimes fail to be released, resulting
  in address in use errors.

  - Fixed issue where auto_connect mdm parameter wasn't working correctly when
  switch_locked=false.

  - Fixed issue where invalid certificate on device would cause the client to
  not connect.

  - Fixed issue in re-connection logic where we would not always try to
  re-connect if there was a network change detected.
