releaseNotes: |
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

  **Notable updates:**
  - Added the ability to customize PCAP options in `warp-cli`.
  - Added a list of installed applications in `warp-diag`.
  - Added a summary of `warp-dex` traceroute results in its JSON output.
  - Improved the performance of firewall operations when enforcing Split Tunnels configuration.
  - Fixed an issue where the DNS logs were not being cleared when the user switched configurations.
  - Fixed an issue where clients using service tokens failed to retry after a network change.
  - Fixed a known issue which required users to re-register when an older single configuration MDM file was deployed after deploying the newer, multiple configuration format.
  - Fixed an issue which prevented the use of private IP ranges that overlapped with end users' home networks.
  - Deprecated `warp-cli` commands have been removed. If you have any workflows that use the deprecated commands, update to the new commands where necessary.
