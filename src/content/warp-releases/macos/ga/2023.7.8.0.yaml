releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains new features, reliability improvements and bug fixes
  from both the previous beta and the previous GA build.
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Added support for "SWG without DNS Filtering" mode. All DNS functionality
  from the WARP client is disabled while in this service mode

  - Added support for ProductVersionExtra to be used in OS Version device
  posture checks

  - Improved performance of domain-based split tunneling when an IP address is
  already split tunneled (seen frequently with Zoom domains and IPs being used)

  - Improved performance of the client when in the "Proxy Only" service mode

  - Modified `warp-cli settings` to show if the applied settings came from local
  (mdm) or network (warp settings profile) policy to make debugging profile
  issues easier

  - Fixed an issue that could result in increased latency when resolving queries

  - Fixed an issue where inputting a license key of excessive length in the
  consumer login could result in high CPU usage

  - Optimized the performance of DNS queries to prevent minor memory leaks

  - Fixed an issue when service token information was removed from .plist the
  client would not prompt for user authentication as expected

  - Fixed 3rd party VPN Compatibility by adding a default /32 subnet to
  interfaces that don't have them by default (this was specifically to fix
  compat with NordLayer but may help others)

  - Fixed an issue where re-authentication button could show up in consumer
  1.1.1.1 mode even though it is just a Zero Trust feature

  - Fixed an issue that could cause many requests for authentication to open in
  the browser

  - Fixed an issue that could cause registration errors when auth ID or other
  parameters are removed from a local MDM/.plist file

  - Fixed an issue where the client would attempt to connect even when the "AUTO
  CONNECT" setting was Disabled in WARP Settings or not specified either in an
  MDM file

  - Fixed an issue where the client could open multiple browser tabs to
  "cloudflareportal.com/test" during authentication scenarios

  - Fixed an issue where the GUI application would auto-populate upon return
  from a standby power state
