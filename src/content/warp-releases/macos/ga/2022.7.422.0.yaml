releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains bug fixes and user experience change for customers using
  Zero Trust `Enforce WARP session duration` Gateway policies
   
  **Notable updates**
   
  - Modified client behavior to no longer automatically open a new browser tab
  when user needs to reauthenticate as this was causing some users to return to
  their devices with 100s of tabs open. Instead the client will now use the
  built in operating system notification framework to inform users of the need
  to authenticate.

  - Fixed issue where file device posture checks wouldn't work correctly when
  the file path was changed for an existing rule.
   
  **Known issues**
