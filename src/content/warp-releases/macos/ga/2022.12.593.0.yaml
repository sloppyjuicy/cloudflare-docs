releaseNotes: >-
  This release has support for new Zero Trust network location aware feature and
  contains improvements to stability and bug fixes.
   
  **Hotfix Updates**

  - Fixed issue where clients could lose IPv4 connectivity (2nd hotfix applied).

  - Fixed issue where clients would attempt to configure DNS even when in
  posture-only, or proxy modes.

  - Increased MDM file timeout to improve compatibility with certain management
  solutions.
    
  **Notable updates in previous GA (2022.12.475.0)**

  - Added support for new Zero Trust network location aware WARP feature. More
  info to be released soon on how you can test.

  - Improved captive portal handling for some more captive portals.

  - Improved reconnect logic when a setting changes to no longer always do a
  full disconnect->reconnect cycle (for instance when turning on DNS logging).

  - Modified initial connectivity check behavior to now validate both IPv4 and
  IPv6 are working (previously we only checked IPv4). Test will pass if either
  connects successfully.

  - Fixed issue where client could be stuck on `Connecting` if certain DNS
  checks failed once.

  - Fixed DNS issue where TXT records were not being correctly returned when at
  the end of a CNAME chain.

  - Fixed issue where the client may not receive notifications of new settings,
  re-auth events or posture from the service until reboot.

  - Fixed issue where users could be pointing at an old gateway_doh_subdomain if
  you have `Allowed to Leave` set to true and they've manually joined their
  client to your organization.

  - Fixed slow DNS timeout issue that could occur when IPv6 is enabled and an
  NXDOMAIN record is returned.

  - Fixed issue with `Gateway with DoH` mode could say `Connected` when it
  wasn't really connected as we could sometimes test the wrong endpoint.

  - Fixed issue where our local DNS proxy server could get unset with an overly
  active DHCP renew time or by plugging in/out a tethered device.

  - Fixed issue where `warp-cli teams-enroll` wouldn't work when an mdm file was
  present.

  - Fixed issue where our localhost dns endpoints (ex. 127.0.2.2) could appear
  in the fallback configuration potentially causing DNS lookups to fail

  - Fixed issues where GUI could crash when opening from the Menu Bar.

  - Fixed issue that could cause some DNS queries to take upto 15 seconds to
  complete.
