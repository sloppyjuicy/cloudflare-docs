  This release primarily contains bug fixes, no new features are included in
  this release
   
  **Notable updates**

  - Modified behavior of `warp-cli enable-dns-log` to automatically turn off
  after 7 days (this is the equivalent of manually running `warp-cli
  disable-dns-log`)

  - Fixed HappyEyeballs search on IPv6 only devices

  - Fixed UI in various states where we would show the wrong text when in
  various states (ex. Paused when really disabled via Admin Override, etc.)

  - Fixed HappyEyeball issue where Safari users without native IPv6 may see
  increased captcha challenges

  Posture tests are now immediately ran on device wakeup and all timers
  restarted

  delete" is run

  - Decreased warp-diag zip file sizes by 60-80%
