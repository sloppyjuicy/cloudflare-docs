  This release contains minor fixes and minor improvements.

    **Notable updates**

    - Added the ability to customize PCAP options in the `warp-cli`.
    - Added a list of installed applications in `warp-diag`.
    - Added a `tunnel reset mtu` subcommand to the `warp-cli`.
    - Added the ability for `warp-cli` to use the team name provided in the MDM file for initial registration.
    - Added a JSON output option to the `warp-cli`.
    - Added the ability to execute a PCAP on multiple interfaces with `warp-cli`.
    - Added MASQUE tunnel protocol support for the consumer version of WARP ([1.1.1.1 w/ WARP](/warp-client/)).
    - Improved the performance of firewall operations when enforcing split tunnel configuration.
    - Fixed an issue where device posture certificate checks were unexpectedly failing.
    - Fixed an issue where the Linux GUI fails to open the browser login window when registering a new Zero Trust organization.
    - Fixed an issue where clients using service tokens failed to retry after a network change.
    - Fixed an issue where the client, when switching between WireGuard and MASQUE protocols, sometimes required a manual tunnel key reset.
    - Fixed a known issue which required users to re-register when an older single configuration MDM file was deployed after deploying the newer, multiple configuration format.
    - Deprecated `warp-cli` commands have been removed. If you have any workflows that use the deprecated commands, update to the new commands where necessary.

    **Known issues:**
